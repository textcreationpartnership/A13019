            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The laſt time I gave you that forme, which I did in a prudentiall way: The ſumme of which conſiſted of 52. Heads, or Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18414:11"/>
partly belonging to the <hi>Porch and Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpice,</hi> and partly to the <hi>Pile, and Edifice</hi> it ſelfe: There were foure things, that I deſire to premiſe in the Frontiſpice,</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Happineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they are all of generall importance, in the firſt gate and entrance; as being the firſt grand inquiries, that will be made (as it were) in the entry.</p>
            <p>How ſhall a man attaine to <hi>true happineſſe?</hi> That is the very firſt thought, the very firſt deſire of the ſoule: and the very ſcope and ſumme of all a mans labours and endeavours: and the very ſcope and ſumme of Religon.</p>
            <p>And the reſolution of that brings in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: That the onely happineſſe is (how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men miſtake) I ſay the onely way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine true happineſſe is, by the Knowledge, Feare, and Service of God, according to the true Religion. And that (as I ſaid) leads to the ſecond Inquirie, which is</p>
            <p>There be many Religions in the world: How ſhall a man know which is the true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?</hi> Which of all the reſt is that, that the ſoule may reſt upon?</p>
            <p>And the anſwer will be: That neither the Pagan and Heatheniſh, nor the Iewiſh, nor the Mahumetane: but in a word, the <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18414:11"/>
Religion,</hi> which is profeſſed in the Church of God; that is the true Religion.</p>
            <p>And that brings us to the third, which is,</p>
            <p>But there be many pretenders to the Church; and a man knowes not which of them is the <hi>true Church?</hi> The reſolution will be, the <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi>: That Church that ſubmits its ſelfe to be regulated by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is the true Church; and then the fourth will be concerning the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now to beginne, and therefore have choſen this portion of Scripture for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; concerning the firſt of theſe foure, <hi>viz.</hi> Concerning <hi>Happineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I will but briefely acquaint you, with one thing which I did not doe the laſt time, and ſo goe on. There be (as I have ſaid) 52. Heads in the whole, for I framed it ſo at the firſt; that (if it might be poſſible) I might goe thorough it, in the compaſſe of one yeare.</p>
            <p>There be theſe foure in the entrance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Body; and in the Body it ſelfe there be fortie eight; whereof there be twenty foure things to be knowne and beleeved; twelve in Generall, and twelve more Particular: and there be as many more, concerning things to be done and practiſed: Twelve concerning the ſumme of duties, that are to be practiſed of a Chriſtian: and twelve concerning the helpes and furtherances that may be uſed, for the better inabling of us to the practiſe of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18414:12"/>
thoſe duties. Now in every of thoſe for our better inſtruction, I purpoſe to obſerve, both the fundamentall truths which are moſt maine and vitall, belonging to every Chriſtian: and will note by the way the oppoſite errors: and withall, as occaſion ſhall ſerve (as I am able) cleare the doubts that may be incident; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtions by way of Speculation, or caſes, by way of practiſe and conſcience.</p>
            <p>And generally I aime at this, to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſumme of all the maine things, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of thoſe Points: each of them in foure principles, or foure Points of Doctrine; and to diſpatch as neere as may be one of them at a time. But yet there is one thing that may ſeeme to be wanting; and I will give but a briefe account of that. It is thus</p>
            <p>There is nothing at all concerning <hi>Divinity</hi> in generall, I purpoſely omitted it: Partly becauſe that diſcourſe may prove more Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall than popular; and not ſo fit to be treated of in ſuch an Auditory: and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo much as may be uſefull in ſuch an Auditory, I ſhall have occaſion in the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to touch on.</p>
            <p>I begin then with the Argument wee have in hand. And as I ſaid, I propound to myſelfe not to exceede the number of foure Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which I ſhall comprehend the maine fundamentall things concerning every Point; and ſo I ſhall doe in this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:18414:12"/>Some thing I muſt therefore firſt premiſe in generall: concerning Happineſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſire of it, which is the ſumme (as I ſaid before) of all the deſires of men: and the ſcope of all Religion: whether all other inſtructions, and truths that are to be handled, are all to be referred.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, I ſhall ſpeake wherein Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Both negatively, that the whole world, and the concurrent meeting of all earthly things cannot make a man happy.</p>
            <p>And affirmatively that the fruition of God alone, and his favour doth make the ſoule truely happy.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place, I ſhall ſpeake of the way, for the attaining of Happineſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is onely by the knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the true Religion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe will be the maine Points, I ſhall ſpeake of. And though ſome of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars might happily be more fully propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of ſome other text of Scripture: yet becauſe I would not multiply more than needs; where I can finde a text, that in any good analogie will fit me, I will confine my ſelfe to that, and ſo in this, where will be all thoſe things contained that I intend to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in this argument. Some explicitely, and ſome implicitely; and yet all directly enough, if we well conſider the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:18414:13"/>I muſt not ſtand upon the Coherence; in briefe therefore, in a word.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of the Pſalme (beſides the Title) conſiſts
<list>
                  <item>1. Partly, <hi>of an humble petition of Grace.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. And Partly, <hi>of a noble profeſsion of Faith.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>There is an <hi>humble petition of Grace</hi> in the firſt Verſe.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>noble profeſsion of the Prophets faith</hi> in the whole Pſalme following, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more

                  <item>
                     <hi>Generally.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>and more <hi>Particularly.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Generall there is</p>
            <p>Firſt of all a reproofe of the vanitie of worldly mens courſes, that they miſtake in their owne good; He taxeth them all of <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and leaſing,</hi> Verſe 2.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, there is an inſtruction of them, concerning the Prophets owne ſtate, and condition: and in generall, who are the happy men, who are in that ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Know you that God hath reſpect to thoſe that are upright towards him:</hi> Know that God chuſeth ſuch, and they are the onely happy men, Verſe the 3.</p>
            <p>And therefore there followeth in the fourth and fifth Verſes, an exhortation of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> to embrace this way, and to ſet themſelves upon making peace with their God; and to ſerve him, that they may
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18414:13"/>
attaine to true happineſſe, in a ſolid and reall way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then there is more particularly laid downe, <hi>The Profeſsion, and confidence of his faith,</hi> with the roote and ground of it, from this Verſe that I have read to the end of the Pſalme.</p>
            <p>Wherein is expreſſely ſet downe, what his happineſſe was:</p>
            <p>Wherein it was conſidered:</p>
            <p>And what muſt be the happineſſe of any, if hee would have it true, <hi>viz.</hi> It is God, and <hi>the light of his countenance,</hi> which is of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort than all other: and which he that injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth may lie downe in ſecuritie, and poſſeſſe his ſoule in peace.</p>
            <p>Now here are all thoſe foure Points, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly, or covertly, which I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to treate of.</p>
            <p>Firſt, wee have the generall deſire of all men, after good, after <hi>happineſſe: Many ſay,</hi> and it may be extended to all, univerſally, and ſo we ſhall conceive the Point thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All men doe univerſally and naturally,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The firſt Doctrine.</note> 
               <hi>deſire that good, that will make a man happie: it is the deſire of all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then wherein doth this happineſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt?</p>
            <p>I confeſſe now here is but little for my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative point (that it doth not conſiſt in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things) directly: But take the conſequent,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18414:14"/>
               <hi>Thou haſt put more joy into my heart, then when their corne and wine increaſed,</hi> Verſe the 7. and take the <hi>Tacite preterition</hi>; The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> lookes a ſquint on all worldly things, paſſeth them by, mentions them not, but turnes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe directly to God, as the onely place of happineſſe: And therein we may ſee (though tacitly) the Negative Point; which is,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſecond Doctrine.</note>
               <hi>That the happineſſe of a man doth not conſiſt in any, or all, of the worldly things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then here is the third Point directly: the poſitive and the affirmative part, <hi>viz.</hi> wherein <hi>our happineſſe doth conſiſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The third Doctrine.</note> 
               <hi>even in the favour of God, Lord lift up the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon us, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here is the fourth and laſt part couched too (eſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we compare the former part of the Pſalme) and that is</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The fourth Doctrine.</note>
               <hi>The way to attaine true happineſſe, is by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſerving, and fearing God, according to the true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is the ſumme of the inſtruction which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives to his oppoſites in the Verſes before the Text: for that very end and purpoſe, to make them owners of true happineſſe.</p>
            <p>I am now to beginne with the firſt, <hi>viz. That it is a generall deſire of all men to attaine to that good, which will make them truely happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Take the <hi>Explication</hi> of the <hi>Propoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be but two things, that I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18414:14"/>
to my ſelfe to open: and the former of them I ſhall doe briefely; becauſe I have had occaſion ſometimes, to treate upon that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in an other portion of Scripture, and therefore I will but remember that briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is <hi>happineſſe?</hi> or what is that good that will make a man happy?</p>

            <p n="1">1. Obſerve the definition of it, which is firſt propounded, I will give a briefe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of happineſſe; or that good that will make a man happy. It is in a word, to ſpeake (properly, and not curiouſly) <hi>that excellent estate of a reaſonable nature wherein it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth &amp; injoyeth that good which it is capable of, and can reaſonably deſire, with Satisfaction, and ſecurity.</hi>

            <p>There be divers particulars in it,<note place="margin">Generally.</note> the which I will but touch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I call it firſt <hi>a ſtate,</hi>

            <p>The firſt inquiry will be concerning the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective happineſſe</hi>; that <hi>good</hi>; the fruition of which will make a man happy.</p>
            <p>And the ſecond inquiry will be of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall</hi>: what kinde of poſſeſſion of ſuch a good doth really, and compleatly make a man happie.</p>
            <p>And indeed happineſſe cannot be perfect without theſe.</p>
            <p>The good, though it have ſome foundation of happineſſe in it, yet there muſt be ſome conjunction of our ſoules with it, it is the conjunction of ſome good, in which wee are intereſſed, that makes up happineſſe: <hi>good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that makes happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now briefely for that good:<note place="margin">The chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of that good that makes us happie. A conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent good.</note> The characters of that good (what ever it be) that muſt make happy are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It muſt be <hi>a good convenient,</hi> ſutable to our nature; which our nature is capable of, for other wiſe the perfection of a Tree or a Horſe, or any other creature doth not make a man happy: it is not to have the perfection of anothers thing, but his owne; it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſutable unto his nature, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It muſt be <hi>an excellent good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good.</note> a good that hath ſome excellencie in it, ſome worth: (for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18414:16"/>
happineſſe is the moſt higheſt, and perfect eſtate) and in a word, it muſt be ſome thing that is better than a mans owne ſelfe, it muſt have more than a mans owne bottome. For as we uſe to ſay, You cannot guild gold with dirt: lay dirt on gold, and it doth not perfect it, or advance it: and ſo in this caſe, to adde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to a man, which is inferiour to a man, (heape up never ſo much of it) you doe not perfect a man, but rather defile him. It muſt therefore be excellent.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">A ſufficient good.</note>3. It muſt be <hi>a ſufficient good</hi>: A man muſt have a ſufficiency; not onely a ſip, or a taſte, but a full draught: Though gold be the beſt, yet a little ſcrapings of gold doe not make a man rich. There muſt be a competent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it muſt be ſufficient.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">A perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent good.</note>4. It muſt be a <hi>permanent good,</hi> that which hath ſome durable ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For if it be waſhy, if it doth vaniſh away, if it be of no abiding, nor of any continuance, it is impoſſible it ſhould concurre towards our happineſſe, or compleate our happineſſe much leſſe. It is the permanencie that ſets the greateſt price, and hath the greateſt influence in the complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our happineſſe: it muſt be permanent.</p>
            <p>But now for the obtaining of this good, which is the ſecond part, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe muſt be made ours.</note>2. <hi>The formall happineſſe:</hi> How muſt it be had, it muſt be made ours, it muſt be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with us, or elſe it will not be our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18414:16"/>
though it hath all theſe conditions.</p>
            <p>There be foure things herein likewiſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one having their waight, and uſe. I will but mention them; and I confeſſe I ſhall but diſtinguiſh them popularly, not Scholaſtically.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">By poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>

            <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">By eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
               <hi>Estimation</hi> of that good: For if a man ſhould have never ſo great a good in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and know hee had the poſſeſſion of it; yet if he have no affection to it, no eſtimation of it; his heart will never be at reſt, which is the maine thing in happineſſe; <hi>viz,</hi> to give a man ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">By fruition.</note>
               <hi>Fruition,</hi> and injoying. When a man injoyeth that good that hee poſſeſſeth and knoweth, and eſteemeth of, therein chiefely conſiſts the happineſſe of happineſſe: <hi>viz. The fruition,</hi> the delicious taſte of that good; that excellent good that a man poſſeſſeth.</p>

            <p>There be theſe degrees of fruition.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>2. <hi>Contentation,</hi> a quietneſſe of the ſoule: which doth chiefely depend, and principally upon the ſufficiency of the good: that a man is not to ſeeke, but is at the center, is at reſt: that he can ſay, <hi>Soule take thine eaſe,</hi> my heart and ſpirit are calmed, and quieted; all troubleſome thoughts and feares, and doubts are off, and I am fully contented. There is not onely delight but ſuch a fulneſſe of delight as giveth content.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

There muſt be ſomething to ſecure the ſoule, and to warrant it, and ſo there muſt be an apprehenſion of the perpetuitie of that eſtate: that it is firme, and a man neede not feare the loſſe of it.

               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:18414:19"/>And then there is a compleat happineſſe, that is both true and compleate.</p>
            <p>And all theſe are ſo, according to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that good thing, upon which they are made, or built.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is <hi>a falſe happineſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">There is a falſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</note> which is built upon any inferiour good, without God, as in the next Point we ſhall ſhew; That not any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor all the creatures in the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; even a full fruition of them, without the fruition of God, with them, and in them, and above them, it makes but a defective, and a falſe happineſſe; that is not worth the name of happineſſe. Although a man may call it in ſome reſpect a happineſſe, as a man may be ſaid to be happy in this reſpect, becauſe he hath a ſound body, and minde; in that reſpect it may be uſed. But ſuch a kinde of hapineſſe as that, comes farre ſhort of the name of true happineſſe, it is a falſe, that is the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There <hi>is a happineſſe true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">There is a true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate.</note> 
               <hi>but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate,</hi> and that is, when a man is in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, that a man doth injoy God (who is the chiefe good, and the greateſt good of all others) though hee hath nothing elſe in the world: may though there were nothing but ſickneſſe, and trouble, and all the miſeries in regard of the outward reſpect, yet God is ſo ſoveraigne a good, that hee that is Gods, hee that is in relation to God, that God ownes him for his owne; ſo that he is in the favour of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18414:20"/>
God; in this reſpect (I ſay) in that hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth God, and injoyeth God (which alone makes him happie) he is truly happy, though not abſolutely; it is true, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate happineſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">There is a compleate happineſſe.</note>3.

            <p>Now the former of thoſe happineſſes, is the happineſſe of the worldlings: who can reach no higher, it is but an imaginary and a falſe happineſſe, it being without God; but (as I ſaid) the worldling can reach no higher, being without God in the world, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true happineſſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the happineſſe of a godly man in this life; they may perhaps be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſhortned, and ſtraightned in reſpect of all worldly things more than the wicked, and ſo more miſerable than other men in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. But yet, God they have, who is that rich good, and invaluable good, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other, they have the favour of God, and therefore they are truely happy, though not compleately.</p>
            <p>But then the third, that is the happineſſe of heaven; where there ſhall be no miſery, nor the reliques of miſery, but a full

compleatneſſe both of body and ſoule, in thoſe relations they have to God, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things by a redundancie as it were, the principall and the eſſentiall thing ſtill being in God, which ſhall be more excellent than any thing we have here; but that is that which we looke for, though God is the chiefe, yet all the reſt is added, and the leaſt accidentarie is without defect, there ſhall be no defect at all in any things.</p>
            <p>Thus of the firſt thing in the Propoſition, what happineſſe is: The ſecond inquirie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes:</p>

            </p>
            <p>I expreſſe it briefely thus. If you deſire an anſwer to the queſtion, according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of it, I ſhall give the anſwer in two cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>Men doe deſire happineſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Morally

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They deſire it ignorantly:</hi> They would have it, but they doe grope for it.<note place="margin">Ignorantly.</note> They are altogether naturally ignorant, even of that which their owne propenſion, and weight of nature carries them to; they ſeeke as the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, <hi>Lots</hi> doore in the darke. They make towards happineſſe, but as in a miſt in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, in a labyrinth, they goe in and out, they follow happineſſe, and deſire it very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:18414:21"/>2. <hi>Very inconſtantly.</hi> Sometimes in one thing,<note place="margin">Inconſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> and ſometimes in another thing, child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. As a child that followes a bird, the bird, if it perceive the child, perhaps may play with it,, and ſit neere it, and then hop away a little, and a little, but at the laſt away it goeth. And ſo we ſhall find it is in the proſecution of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe among men. Many deſire it, but it is wonderous ſtaggeringly, and inconſtantly, even like drunken men, in and out; ſometimes they think this will make them happy; &amp; then all might and maine goeth for that: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again an other thing takes off the fancy, and then all for it; and anone they are taken off from that, and then another thing, they are weary of that too: there is no ſatisfaction, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way craving, and from one to another, never ſtill, and ſo very inconſtantly. So that as they do it very <hi>ignorantly</hi>: ſo likewiſe inconſtantly. And ſo you have the morall anſwer.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note>2. All men naturally deſire happineſſe; and that is my Point. And ſo it comprehends two things, which I will briefly open, and ſo come to the profe of the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They deſire it <hi>naturally,</hi> and ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally. And becauſe they deſire it naturally, they doe deſire it univerſally.</p>
            <p>It is not the deſire of one, or two, or a good pretty part of men, but all univerſally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all men deſire it, good and bad, wicked and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, howſoever they miſſe in the particular; yet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18414:21"/>
generally all men deſire happineſſe. And therefore that which a Father long ago obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon an occaſion of the act of a jeſter, that came upon the Stage to make the people ſport with tricks; he told them that hee would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to tell unto every one that was there preſent, men and women their thoughts, and what every one of them deſired. There was great expectation ſtill what he would ſay: at laſt he tells them, <hi>vili vultis emere, &amp; care vendere. i. e.</hi> You all deſire to buy cheape, and ſell deare. But ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> if this man had told them, you all would be happy, hee ſhould have ſpoken more truely, for that is not true in ſome reſpect: good men and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men are not greedy to make bargaines for advantage alwayes. But yet if he had ſaid you all doe deſire to be happy, hee had ſpoken without all exception. None would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it, or gaine ſaid it; but every one would be a happy man.</p>
            <p>And this will appeare to be true, if you take but two or three diſtinctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take a diſtinction in <hi>regard of the thing happineſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</note> the thing that I affirme to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally deſired.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Take a diſtinction of <hi>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take it with theſe conſiderations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you will finde it to be an infallible truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make a diſtinction of happineſſe, which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18414:22"/>
I expreſſe thus: Happineſſe may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<list>
                  <item>Either in <hi>generall,</hi> to be happy.</item>
                  <item>Or in <hi>particular,</hi> to be happy this or that way.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Generall.

But here is an infinite difference, <hi>quot bomines, tot ſententiae:</hi> men are divided in the particular, wherein they do place their happineſſe; And yet they that are divided in the branches are united in the roote, and all doe agree, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire together in this (even thoſe that are at the greateſt oddes) that they doe make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards happineſſe. That man that rejoyceth like a Gyant to runne the wayes of God: He doth it out of the deſire of happineſſe; but placed in that which the worldly man thinkes to bee no happineſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in the favour of God, and obedience to his Commandements, and the getting of everlaſting life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes haſte that way. And a man that runnes the quite contrary way, head-long and poſt to hell, he cannot tell how to be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough, in the proſecution of evill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet that man doth it out of a deſire, to come to happineſſe, but onely he miſplaceth his happineſſe in the wrong thing, and is out of the way to it. So, that is the firſt thing, all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18414:22"/>
men in generall deſire happineſſe, though in the particular they agree not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Make a diſtinction of <hi>deſire,</hi> or <hi>appetite</hi>;<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</note> and it is double.</p>

            <p>Concerning the firſt,<note place="margin">Illicite.</note> whether a man doth deſire illicitly, that is, whether a man doth by a firme and actuall deſire, deſire to come to happineſſe, I will affirme nothing.</p>
            <p>But of the latter it is true,<note place="margin">Innate.</note> for without all queſtion, there is an <hi>innate appetite</hi>: there is a naturall deſire of the ſoule of happineſſe. As the ſtone doth weigh downeward towards the center, which is the place of its reſt: even ſo the ſoule of a man weigheth, and preſſeth towards the center of reſt, towards that place, what ever it be; towards that thing in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of which it may be at reſt: there is (I ſay) a naturall <hi>pondus</hi> or weight of the ſoule that way, whether it be illicite, I ſay nothing, and yet that may ſomething appeare by the third; which is,</p>
            <p>A diſtinction <hi>of men:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Condition of men.</note> there be divers ſorts of men, yet I will not meddle with any thing now, but give one diviſion.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. There be <hi>wiſe men.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Men that are wiſe, and men that are weake.</p>
            <p>Now their deſire of happineſſe is different,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18414:23"/>
according to the different rankes of men in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Weak men.</note>Weaker men that have but weake intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, &amp; weake underſtandings, it may be that they live like beggers all their life, and have no habitation of their owne, but doe rove up and downe the countrey; they make not any marke or deſigne of their lives; ſet up no ſcope that they ſhoot at, and doe not levell their actions to come to that ſcope; weake men, it may be, doe not ſo actually make ſome deſigne, at which they aime. But now wiſe men make ſome end,<note place="margin">Wiſe men.</note> ſet up happineſſe as their worke, and ſo do levell all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to meete there: the more ſtrength of wiſedome and underſtanding is in a man, the more actually, and ſtrongly he doth it. It is for a wiſe man to have a ſcope, a marke to aime and drive at: and he is a weake man that doth not make ſome deſigne, propound ſome marke (wherein he thinkes probable to attaine to happineſſe) and preſſe towards it.</p>
            <p>And now with this difference, and being thus opened, it is a cleare truth, that there is a natural deſire in all men towards happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and that univerſall good, and this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralneſſe ſheweth the univerſality.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note>2. <hi>They deſire it neceſſarily.</hi> There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary deſire, as thoſe that are the great pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trons of the liberty of the will acknowledge; they that doe maintaine that man hath an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18414:23"/>
freedome of will; yet all of them doe agree, that this freedome is not expreſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning happineſſe: a man is not free whether he will will happineſſe or not, but his will is actuated, and determinated that way, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſire it whether hee will or no (I ſay) he cannot but will happineſſe, There is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inſtinct of God upon him, by which hee doth poize towards happineſſe; it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and therefore both univerſall in all, and neceſſarie, without diſcourſe or reaſoning, or choiſe and liberty, but out of neceſſity, as the greateſt patrons of Libertiniſme acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Thus of the explication of the Point:<note place="margin">Proofe.</note>

<q>Many ſay, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That is, as I conceive, all men: There be many places of Scripture that runne upon this ſtring, and are built on this foundation: All the arguments that God uſeth to induce a man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this, taken from our happineſſe, doe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue that God would worke on the advantage of nature, and that there is a naturall deſire of happineſſe, and therefore hee propounds thoſe things that will conduce to a mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, that ſhould induce him. And thus

therefore hee propounds the Law, <hi>chuſe life or death</hi>; and thus Chriſt propounds the Goſpell. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart.</hi> Hee uſeth an argument of bleſſedneſſe; on this ground of nature, there is a deſire of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he comes to worke, ſhewing the way how a man may come to that he deſires, how he may compaſſe his owne deſire.</p>

               <note place="margin">Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note>1. <hi>Reaſon</hi>: It is a thing <hi>implanted in us by the conſtitution of nature:</hi> God made a man for an end, and for a happineſſe, capable of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and therefore planted an inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him, to carry him along, and poize him towards this happineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon:</hi> Not blotted out by corruption: <hi>corruption hath not blotted this out</hi>: Though man be corrupted by the fall, and, is growne degenerate from the excellency of nature. Yea though in many other things, many principles are ſo beaten out, of particular goodneſſe, and particular vertues, that a man hath loſt the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, and the lineaments of them; which was in him at the firſt: yet this is ſo intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and ſo innate in nature, ſo graven in it; that even the fall hath not blotted it out: That
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18414:24"/>
even in corruption ſo long as there is a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall creature, the nature of a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo, that of its owne will, it deſires good; it cannot but deſire good, and that which is the conflux of all good, happineſſe: even cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption itſelfe doth retaine thus much of the reverſion of the integrity of nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Left for ſtockes to graft Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> This is left <hi>for a ſtocke to graft Renovation on:</hi> it is for a very good end, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> ſtumpe was, becauſe God meant to reſtore him againe, ſo that although the tree were lopt downe, yet there was a ſtocke left, &amp;c. So God hath left this to be a ſtocke to graft on; If there were not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of nature, that a man had a deſire to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, for God to conveigh the doctrine of happineſſe, and give directions to attaine it, there were no ground worke, to worke upon a man to induce him to ſuch things. For as a great man of this Kingdome ſometimes ſaid, I doe thinke there is a truth, and an elegancy in the obſervation; <hi>God grafts the plant of grace upon the ſtocke of nature.</hi> If there were not a ſtocke of nature, ſo farre forth as a man is a reaſonable creature, ſome generall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and inclinations; there were no dealing with a man towards his renovation: But this is left as a ground worke, for God to worke better things upon: We have ſome deſire to happineſſe, and therefore when God comes to direct him to happineſſe, hee hath ſome

thing to worke upon, ſomething in nature to make him capable of it; of underſtanding, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, and cloſing with it. Not that hee hath an active power, but as it were, a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or capacity of it. And therefore as they that ſpinne, doe not ſpinne out all the whole thred, but leave ſome end, that they may adde to it another thred, So God having a purpoſe to doe good on man in his renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he did not altogether ſuffer the ſtocke of nature to be wholly rooted out, but left that as a hint, or roote to graft upon, to make him capable of happineſſe the better.</p>

It is the ſcope of all things, that are to be taught and learned. Wherefore doe we learne or teach, but to bring men to happineſſe? And therefore as it is in ſhooting, it is neceſſary that a man ſhould ſee the marke that he ſhootes at that ſo he may levell at, that marke; So in treating
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18414:25"/>
of Divine knowledge, as they ſay of all practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call arts, the naturall method is to beginne at the end, to ſet downe the end whether all things tend, that a man ſhoote not at Rovers: So this gives my account, and the reaſon why I thus placed this point here. It might be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the beginning what ſhould be the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of alt that a man learnes, or heares: All muſt bee ſuch things as doe conduce towards our happineſſe, and he muſt gather it peece by peece, to make up his happineſſe, ſeeing it is that which we all deſire.</p>

unto it; now here is the excellency of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that it teacheth this unto a man faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truely: and therefore infinitely to be advanced above all other profeſſions in the world. All Philoſophy, or matter of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or other trades, is that by which a man makes up a temporall living, and comes farre ſhort of Divinity.

to bring it ſo home, to ſhew the light ſo cleare, and ſo neare before a man, that hee cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it, and yet when he doth it, he doth it ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly, and invincibly working ſo on the inclination of nature, upon our owne deſires, that there is no violence to the will at all, he can ſtrike in, and overcome it in a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie of our nature by vertue of our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſires.</p>

honourable, or high, or had in reputation (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be of high price in noble mindes, and gives a great ſatisfaction to them) yet there is no happineſſe at all in it: It comes farre too ſhort to make a man happy.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="2">2. I will but adde the ſecond thing,<note place="margin">Friends.</note> and that is this; <hi>No content, or compleate ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in friends</hi>; no relation that a man hath, in which, his naturall content doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in; as parents, or children, and others that are neare, and deare unto him; nor any other of thoſe friends, that may be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18414:32"/>
and have a greater influence in their good, as the favour of great ones, and the like, no friend or relation to a man, though that be a great ſweetnes, as the Wiſeman expreſſeth. Or as the Father expreſſeth it very well. Though a man drinke nothing but Ambroſia, or Nectar, all his life, and have no friend to partake of it, there would not be any ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto him in it.</p>
               <p>So I ſay, though it much ſweeten the life, yet it cannot reach ſo farre (although hee were never ſo bleſt in that kinde) as to make him happy.</p>
               <p>It is not any of theſe things will doe it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>intrinſecall goods</hi> of the <hi>minde,</hi> nor the <hi>extrinſecall</hi> of the <hi>body</hi>; it is not <hi>Pleaſure</hi> to ſatisfie the body, nor <hi>honour</hi> to ſatisfie the minde; nor any other thing to ſatisfie both; neither eſtate, nor friends, none of theſe can give a man true happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then there is an other branch, to make the point more full, <hi>viz. not all of theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not the <hi>quinteſſence of any</hi> of thoſe fully, nor the <hi>confluence of many,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Not the confluence of any.</note>

               <p n="1">1. It is not <hi>any of them alone</hi> can doe it; for a man is a compound creature both of body and ſoule, and therefore thoſe things which make it up muſt be for both: for ſuppoſe a man had a Beaver hat, and a gold hat-band, a ſatten dublet, and the like: yet if in the meane
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18414:32"/>
time hee goe bare-legg'd, this is farre from compleateneſſe, becauſe there is one thing wanting: ſo it will be in the matter of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: It is not conceiveable that one alone ſhould doe it; to have the minde full, or the body full, to injoy but one peece, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a man happy. And therefore</p>
               <p n="2">2. I adde this in the ſecond place, not the confluence of all together, though all were concentred together in one, and conſpired to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to make a man happy, yet they would come ſhort. Though a man had wiſedome, and vertue, and goods of body, as ſtrength, and beauty, though he had all outward orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though hee injoyed honour and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the full, and riches, and friends, nay, though he had all theſe meeting in one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and concentred in one man, they come farre ſhort of making a man happy, and he may be a miſerable man (though hee have all theſe) in this Theologicall ſenſe. Thus we ſee no created thing can doe it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Theſe things without God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe things conſidered without God cannot doe it.</hi> For there is a great deale of difference betweene thoſe as they ſtand <hi>in relation to God,</hi> and in conjunction with him, and as they are <hi>without him,</hi> and ſtand upon their owne bottome, and in their owne ſtrength, and excellencie.<note place="margin">With God they may make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With God</hi> it is true, theſe things may make ſome <hi>acceſsion to happineſſe,</hi> they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne

and beautifie happineſſe, and have ſome part and place in happineſſe in an inferiour kinde; they are in themſelves, and in their kinde <hi>good,</hi> and they are the <hi>gifts of God,</hi> and thoſe that hee beſtoweth on man for this purpoſe, to inch out, and helpe out their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in ſome kinde, or other; as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> diſtinguiſheth very well: there be <hi>Bona Thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, &amp; bona Scabelli</hi>; goods of the Throne of happineſſe, which is God and Chriſt: and goods of the Footſtoole, as thoſe inferiour things: It is true, the throne of a godly mans happineſſe is in heaven; but yet the Foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole may be upon earth. For a man being a compound creature, is not a meere ſimple ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated ſpirit: but hee hath a body likewiſe, and therefore thoſe outward and lower things may ſome way be conducible towards his outward happineſſe, and be in an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this happineſſe: eſpecially when they doe not derogate or diminiſh from the other: when they make no wall of ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God, and the ſoule; but are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with God, and proceede out of Gods favour and love towards us; and that for our good; and ſo farre they may make an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to happineſſe: as it is with ciphers, put a thouſand of them and they make no number, but put the leaſt figure before them, and they make up a great number. So all thoſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, are but ciphers without God; but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18414:33"/>
if they ſtand in conjunction with God, they may make ſome acceſſion to happineſſe, and be ſubſervient to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Without God they cannot doe it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Without God they cannot doe it.</note> they can neither give the <hi>reall,</hi> nor the <hi>royall happineſſe.</hi> It is impoſſible without God they ſhould doe it.</p>
               <p>Though there may be an imagination of happineſſe in thoſe men,<note place="margin">May breed imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</note> who are the owners of them: they may fill themſelves with dreames and fancies, as though they were in a happy eſtate, and condition,<note place="margin">Cannot give poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it.

               </p>
               <p>Now there may be a double degree of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe propounded;

               <p>To mention that firſt, wherein this argument is treated in. It is the ſame with this wherein happineſſe is ſeated. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. at the beginning; our Saviour there in this Sermon upon the Mount, purpoſely treats of happineſſe, and bleſſedneſſe: Hee ſets the crowne of bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or happineſſe on the head of many things. As, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that are poore in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18414:35"/>
Spirit; Bleſſed are thoſe that mourne; Bleſſed are the meeke, &amp;c.</hi> But among all thoſe hee mentions there, he mentions none of thoſe created good things wherein a man might ſuppoſe they ſhould be: There is not, <hi>Bleſſed is the rich man,</hi> or <hi>Bleſſed is the honourable man</hi>; or the <hi>wiſeman,</hi> or he that injoyes the goods of beauty, or riches, or ſtrength of body, and the like. None of thoſe things mentioned. But all theſe things that are mentioned there are <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,</hi> and <hi>heavenly graces,</hi> that put a man into fellowſhip, and communion with God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Scripture is that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.12. where the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is in a way of directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Come to me my children, &amp; I wil inſtruct you in the way to happineſſe</hi>; who is he that <hi>deſires to ſee good</hi>; to <hi>live long,</hi> and <hi>ſee good dayes</hi>; to ſee happineſſe, and to come to happines. Where he mentions none of thoſe things, as I named before: but the ſame that our Saviour ſeemes to expreſſe, and hee excludes other things. Hee directs to ſpirituall wayes, and ſpirituall meanes for the accompliſhment of happineſſe; but for earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, hee doth not ſo much as once name them. And then againe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. about the beginning, there is a full proofe of it, in the whole beginning; there the Prophet reckons up the propriety, and the happineſſe of wicked men: and expreſſeth it ſo much the fuller, becauſe the gliſter of theſe worldly things had dazled the eyes of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> and they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18414:35"/>
had <hi>almoſt made his feete to ſtippe; Ver.</hi> 2. He was ſo taken with the flare of earthly things, and the proſperous ſtate of men in worldly things, that hee began to bleſſe in his heart, and thinke well of thoſe that injoyed them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine at his owne eſtate: and thus hee was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away till God brought <hi>him into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. Verſe</hi> 18. There hee found that all thoſe that had them were not happy; but thoſe that had them were <hi>ſet in ſlippery places.</hi> There was no ſoliditie of happineſſe, that could be gathered out of thoſe things; when God brought him into the ſanctuary, then hee learned there, that there was no true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all theſe earthly things.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144. the laſt <hi>verſe,</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> there in the beginning of the Verſe, ſeemed to looke this way, as though there were happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in theſe created things: <hi>Happy are the people that are in ſuch a caſe:</hi> the people that flouriſh in proſperity, as in the foregoing Verſes: and ſo farre indeede, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with God, there is ſomething of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in them: But leſt any ſhould miſtake the Prophet; he corrects himſelfe againe, and ſaith (as if hee did unſay what he he had ſaid) <hi>Happy are the people who have God for their Lord</hi>: They are happy men whoſe God is the Lord, that is the right of it; it is not theſe things wherein true happineſſe lies, though they may be ſubſervient to it, and ſomething
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18414:36"/>
conducible to happineſſe, yet our happineſſe doth lie in our conjunction with God.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.23. gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a caution. <hi>Let not the Wiſeman glory in his wiſedome, nor the ſtrong man in his ſtrength, nor the rich man glory in his riches</hi>; none of theſe things can make a man happy; theſe are not the things that a man can delight in, or boaſt of; there muſt be other things that muſt make up this happineſſe, or elſe we ſhall come ſhort of it.</p>
               <p>And ſo in, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. See what the Apoſtle ſaith, concerning one thing, which hath the greateſt ſhew and ſplendor, <hi>viz. Riches. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded,</hi> and that <hi>they truſt not in their uncertaine riches.</hi> That they doe not build a conceited happineſſe in, or upon them; and thinke they are in a good eſtate by reaſon of them; the Apoſtle doth it with authoritie, and efficacie, and hee would have it laid home to them, becauſe men are exceeding apt to cozen themſelves, in ſuch things.</p>
               <p>And to give ſomething as the Reaſon of it: Looke <hi>Hoſeah</hi> 1.21.22. Alas, all theſe things and the goodneſſe of them (ſo farre as they may conduce in an inferiour ranke for our good) depend upon God, as God by the Prophet there ſaith. <hi>In that day, ſaith the Lord, I will heare the heavens, and they ſhall

Neither wanted there any <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> for if he had all other things, and wanted skill, it had beene nothing, he might have gone the wrong way to worke. But hee wanted not skill to make an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although it had beene to draw fire out of flint; as Alchymiſts can draw oyle out of iron, whereas ordinary people can draw little moiſture out of it, being they want skill to fetch out the quinteſſence of it. But it cannot be ſaid ſo of <hi>Salomon,</hi> he had meanes and wit to fetch out all the vertue in them; and to ſucke the quinteſſence out, to ſift the things to the branne, as they ſay. But then againe, if a man had both meanes and wit to doe it, yet if he had not a minde to it, he could not doe it; But it cannot be ſaid ſo of him, for he had a <hi>minde to try; Salomon</hi> ſet his heart to it, to try the nature of all the world, and worldly things; to try what was in pleaſure, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and muſicke, and ſinging, and all things that may give content to the heart of man.

Neither the intrinſecall goods of the minde, nor the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall of the body, or eſtate, no nor all thoſe that are more excellent, not any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18414:44"/>
to ſatisfie the body, nor any honour to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the minde, nor any other thing to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both, whether friends or eſtate, &amp;c. none of thoſe can bring a man true happineſſe.</p>
               <p>No nor the confluence of many, or all of them together, although all were concentred together in one, yet they would prove ſhort of making a man happy.</p>
               <p>But we added this caution. None of theſe, nor all of them without God can doe it.</p>
               <p>And for the predicate, wee did ſhew, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſidered, a naturall or a ſpirituall happineſſe; or a true and perfect happineſſe, they come ſhort of making truely happy. And for the proofe, it was done by Scripture, and experience: <hi>Salomons,</hi> and every ones ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhew the <hi>Hoti</hi> of the Point that it is ſo. And the <hi>Dihoti</hi> wee ſhewed thus: <hi>viz.</hi> That, that which makes happy muſt give per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſatisfaction, which all worldly things cannot doe. And wee made it appeare by conſidering the nature of earthly things, and the nature of man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ſhewed, if wee doe conſider the nature of worldly things, there will be found wanting all the dimenſions of happineſſe;</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, mans nature is too capacious to be ſatisfied with worldly things, which are narrow and defective.</p>
               <p>Wee come now to the application of the Point, which I deſired, and thought to have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18414:45"/>
finiſhed the laſt time; and therefore I did caſt it into a compendious mould, ſo as it might have gone along with the other; time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me; and now I ſhall reſolve not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it, but to deliver it in the ſame compaſſe, and with the ſame brevitie, I then intended; partly becauſe I finde ſome weakeneſſe which makes me not altogether fit to inlarge much; and partly, becauſe what ever may ſeeme to be defective, or ſhort in this place; there will be ſufficient opportunity in the next Point to bring it in, wherein wee ſhall treate of the poſſitive part of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein it lies indeede, if it doe not lie in theſe worldly things to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.</p>

                  <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> reckons up no leſſe than 288. ſeverall opinions of ſeverall learned Philoſophers, that placed happineſſe, one in one thing, and another in another thing; every one being different, and oppoſing one another, every one contradicting what others had ſaid, and being confident of his owne. But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Romanos</hi> in the like cauſe, <hi>Rom,</hi> 1.22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And indeed, this is a point, that it is not to be expected, that the conceit of naturall reaſon, or the naturall light of a man, ſhould ever be able to guide a man ſteadily to. No marvell that they did ſpeake like blinde men, like drunken men, and runne in a labyrinth, in a miſſe maze, and were not able to get out of it, having not the lanthorne of the light of divine revelation to lead them out. It is not worth the while to ſpeake par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of them, I ſhall content my ſelfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a briefe touch of them.</p>
               <p>We ſee all the opinions of Philoſophers,&amp; all their knowledge cleane out of the way, yea, and the wiſedome of all naturall men, is too ſhallow by farre, and all naturall abilities,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18414:46"/>
to come to ſhew ſteadily wherein true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lies. If nature could have done it, then the learnedſt wits, and wiſedome might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily have found it out. But they could not, they groped in the darke, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> when they were ſtrucken with blindneſſe gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to find <hi>Lots</hi> doore; ſo they groped to ſee if by any meanes they might finde out happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but they had not light enough to doe it.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, to mention that which is not ſo farre out of the way; wee will not meddle here now with Philoſophers.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of others</hi>; We may learne to judge what is true happineſſe, and who are the happy men. And if we will doe this aright, wee muſt not doe it <hi>Populari trutina,</hi> not weigh it in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the world, but come to the ballance of the Sanctuary, and weigh things there, by which it will appeare evidently, as out of this truth that wee have named, and treated on, who are happy, and who not. We ſhould not thinke thoſe the happy men, that have either the excellency, or the confluence of theſe worldly things: As when I ſee a man, ſuppoſe one that hath a very great eſtate, and hath plenty of all in this world: Suppoſe he hath with that many perfections of body, as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſtrength: Suppoſe hee with all this hath many excellencies of minde, that hee is pregnant in underſtanding, and admirable in many ſuch abilities. We are ready as <hi>Samuel</hi> was in the cauſe of <hi>David</hi>; wee are ready to miſtake the true happy man, and to ſet the crowne of happineſſe upon the wrong head, as he was ready to powre out the Oyle

upon <hi>Eliah</hi> the eldeſt ſonne, and a goodly man, and leaſt of all though upon poore little <hi>David,</hi> that was an out caſt and abroad in the field as a Shepheard; and this man <hi>Eliah</hi> was a Gentleman, a Gallant home with his Father, and hee keeping his Fathers ſheepe; but God placed the crowne upon him, though, as I ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> was ready to miſtake. And we are ready to doe ſo in this cauſe that wee now ſpeake of. But now this point will, and ſhould helpe to rectifie and guide our hands aright in placing of the crowne of happineſſe: and it teacheth us not to meaſure by worldly things, not to count thoſe the happy men that are the darlings of Fortune, that are lulled aſleepe in the lap of the world, and are dandled there, and have all plenty, and abundance of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Our owne happineſſe.</note>2. This may rectifie our judgements concerning our owne happineſſe; in this the deceit is more dangerous. As this will helpe us to judge of others, ſo of our ſelves: wee ſhould not therefore (if wee will be true to this Point, and doe remember it well) be in danger to bleſſe our ſelves, and ſooth up our ſelves, as though wee were in eſtate of happineſſe, when things goe ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us.

A man were better be in a bad and blind eſtate and condition, than in ſuch a condition, as hath a kind of glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of happineſſe, which keepes him off from the true happineſſe, and makes him runne many times upon the rocke of true miſery, out of a falſe conceit, that he is already in the ſtate of happineſſe.

                  <note place="margin">The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of worldly men</note>1. The practiſes of worldly men. It is cleare enough that all worldly men that are made up of dirt, and who carry about them the curſe of the Serpent. <hi>Vpon thy belly ſhall thou go, &amp; duſt ſhalt thou eate.</hi> They are like the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Goſpel that had <hi>a ſpirit of infirmity for ſo many yeares that grew crooked downward,</hi> towards the earth.

They are cleane out of the way, and miſtake foully as the Father ſpeakes; <hi>Vitam beatam quarunt in regione mortis.</hi> It is a foule miſtake to looke to finde heaven in hell; happineſſe in miſery; ſuch are they that minde nothing but worldly things. And they are clearely to be reproved.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Of Godly men.</note>2. The <hi>practiſes of the godly men here repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> There are many that doe not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to godlineſſe, but doe participate (it may be in ſome degree) of godlineſſe, that are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18414:48"/>
blame worthy too. If our happineſſe lie not in worldly things, as it doth not, why then doe godly men ſoule their hands, and diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their names, in being ſo greedy in their purſuit of theſe worldly things; in being too having, and taking too much delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in them, and being infinitely grieved at the loſſe of them; and ſo for all other the ſymptomes which argue an adherency of the ſoule to them. It argues a roote of bitterneſſe, in them, in ſome degree, and that they place more happineſſe in theſe worldly things, then God would have them, or then hee ever did: for, every man doth proportion his care in ſeeking after any thing, according, to his eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the conjunction of that thing which hee ſeekes after, with his happineſſe; happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being the end of all a mans aimes. Hee would not minde over much, or be greedy over-much of any thing, but that there is a ſecret eſtimation in a mans breaſt, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere alyed, and of very neere kinne to his happineſſe. Now it is cleare and evident amongſt us, that there is this fault even in godly men, that they doe too much licke up the duſt, and doe too much groape after worldly things, and ſet too great a price upon them, and therefore the reproofe reacheth to them alſo. I may well make uſe of that which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaid ſometime, that if he were the fitteſt in the world, to preach a Sermon to the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18414:49"/>
whole world gathered together in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and had ſome high mountaine for his pulpit, from whence he might have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all the world in his view, and were furniſhed with a voyce of braſſe, a voyce as loud as the trumpet of the Arch-angell, that all the world might heare him, he would chuſe to Preach upon no other Text, then that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, even in this <hi>Pſalme, O mortall men how long will ye love vanity; and follow after leaſing</hi>; thoſe deceitful things of the world which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe happineſſe, when they cannot make it good. It is that which would make a Sermon of a generall reproofe to all the world, and come home to every one.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Pretences there.</note>2. But now to come to the ſecond thing I propounded, which I will but briefely touch on. Beſides thoſe <hi>Practiſes,</hi> Men have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> to excuſe themſelves upon ſome faire colours, and ſuch poſſibly may be in them yet for all theſe pretences we may otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne well enough, that they place their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe too much of it, at leaſt in theſe worldly things, yet that they may not deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves we will examine them.</p>
               <p>The beſt plea of all is, that they doe but make conſcience of their duty, we are to ſeeke theſe worldly things in ſome meaſure, becauſe God appointed every one to doe it, and the hand of the diligent ſhall make rich. God hath made us our owne executioners, our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18414:49"/>
to be <hi>fabirs fortunae</hi> in ſome ſenſe; to be ſervers of our ſelves, and to helpe our ſelves with the neceſſaries of this life. And the conſideration of a mans charge and family, and eſtate, and ſuch like, will afford a man plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible gloſſes, and probable arguments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, even thoſe that are moſt deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tainted with this poyſon, and guilty of this fault, yet thinke to wind out of all reproofe, and eſcape the blow thereof with ſuch faire pretences.</p>
               <p>But briefely in a word for anſwer (for I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to ſift things to the branne, and to proſecute them ſo cloſe) in a word therefore for anſwer, I ſhall give but a touch.</p>
               <p>There be two things that I deſire every one to conſider, againſt all their pretences, beſide one thing which I deſire may be conſidered in generall.</p>
               <p>I deſire no man would deale with me, or with any other that ſhould cal on them, to take heed of immoderate love of worldly things, or an immoderate proſecution of them, I ſay not deale with us, as many wil deale with man: for though men have no ſuch art as to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of men, men have not a window to looke into the breſt, and ſee the ſecrets of his heart, and thoughts. I am contented to conceive ſo charitably of you, and charitably to interpret and excuſe, except I ſee the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be over groſſe, if it be not extravagant,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18414:50"/>
and exorbitant, I will candidly make the beſt conſtruction: But remember that beſides man, whom thou maiſt put off with words (becauſe hee hath no ſuch art to ſee thy inwards) yet thou haſt a God to deale withall, and thou haſt a great Tribunall, at which thou muſt give up a reckoning; thou haſt a conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee to deale withall, which will once be awakned. And though I be not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee, that thou doſt too much poize to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and poſt after worldly things, that thou goeſt beyond the golden line of medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie; yet if thy owne conſcience doe accuſe thee, conſulting with the Word of God, and thoſe many paſſages in it which point out this ſinne; that if there be any truth and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the Word, all thoſe paſſages flie in thy face, and proclaime thee guilty, that thou art guilty of this ſinne; I ſay, thinke not becauſe now thou canſt put mee off with ſuch flimme-flamme excuſes, thou canſt put off God too; then daube not with God, and thine owne conſcience, with whom it is to no purpoſe to diſſemble; this being premiſed in generall, I ſhall adde but theſe two things in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">There ſhould be a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note>1. Firſt of all, conſider that there is a <hi>very vaſt, and wide, and broad difference,</hi> betweene thoſe <hi>affections</hi> which wee ſhould have <hi>to God,</hi> and thoſe which we are allowed <hi>to uſe for the world, and worldly things:</hi> There is a vaſt, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18414:50"/>
broad difference betweene the excellencie of the one, and the vanity of the other; and therefore there ſhould be as vaſt, and broad a difference in our proſecutions, and affections towards the one, and towards the other; and if there be not a very broad difference, that thou doſt infinitly more purſue after God, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things (which are infinitly of more worth than all worldly things) than thou doſt after any worldly thing. If there be ſo nice a difference that thou canſt hardly diſtinguiſh and diſcerne, which is predominate in thee, or which thou doſt moſt looke after; in which thou placeſt the greateſt part of thy felicitie, thou art guilty; for it cannot be right, unleſſe there be a broad difference; becauſe it is but reaſonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If God be ſo infinitely tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent above all theſe worldly things; and goe ſo farre beyond all thoſe earthly things, as that they are all but as the duſt of the ballance in weight againſt God: Then if thou doſt ſeeke theſe things, and minde theſe things, and doſt doe it any way as much as thou doſt God, it is certaine thou doſt it inordinately and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly. And therefore to end this, I would deſire every one, but to try their conſciences and their hearts, and ſee whether they can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne ſuch an infinit diſtance in themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the price they ſet upon God, &amp; heavenly things, &amp; the proſecution after them, and that price they ſet upon, &amp; the proſecution they do
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18414:51"/>
make after worldly things; if they doe not finde the difference wide, but that their hearts doe bend and warpe too much towards worldly things, it is certaine hee is guilty of this fault which I now taxe, and the words doe meet with him in a juſt reproofe, and hee hath neede to be humbled for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

when as alas, all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences will be but as Fig-leaves to cover him. As ſuppoſe now in an other caſe, I ſhould palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate an inordinate love to the maid, more than to the wife, and yet the wife deſerve more of love; this is a great ſuſpition, for there is a great deale of difference, that is betweene the one, and the other, if I ſhould not make a broad difference betweene the one and the other, I might be ſuſpected; and I will aſſure you, how ever a man may be free from the ſinne, yet hee cannot be free from the ſuſpition of an adulterous minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe worldly things, if there be not a vaſt diſtinction, and a broad difference in our

But I know there may be many difficulties in this, and ſome that may be juſtly objected againſt this character, and therefore having given this in generall, I paſſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Paines.</note>But ſecondly, an other thing there is, that may come a little cloſer, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>paines wee take,</hi> eſpecially with the intention of the minde laid together: admit it be neceſſary, and Gods owne appointment, and the thing requires it, that no time muſt be ſpent otherwiſe: for the great Publican of the world (Sleepe) takes up much tribute of a mans time, and takes out a great portion: And the neceſſary reparation of this rotten cottage of ours; meate and drinke take a great deale of our time. And the labour of a mans particular vocation; all theſe muſt needs take up a great deale more of a mans time for the world, then a man doth immediatly for the ſervice of God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame: well, ſuppoſe that.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Thoughts and cares.</note>But now examine in the next place the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of thy paines, eſpeciall with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of thy affections, and thy heart, which hath the moſt full gale of thy paines, and which art more eager upon. I ſay, if thou doſt neither give God the principall of thy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18414:52"/>
time, nor beſtow the greateſt part of thy time upon him, yet doſt thou give him the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of thy heart and affections; that though thou art neceſſitated to converſe more about the world, then for God; why, yet if thou doſt it more eagerly, and with a greater ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſſe of affections towards God; and thy heart doth infinitely more prize, and love, and eſteeme of God, and goeth with more alacrity and cheerefulneſſe, and more heate, and delectation of ſpirit, when thou art about God and about heavenly things, than it doth about worldly things, this may be ſome thing indeed; but if there goeth together with the flower of thy time, the eagerneſſe of thy heart and affections towards earthly things, that thy heart is corrupted with them, and thy judgement, and thy eſtimations drawne after them, and thou art builded more on them, and pleaſed more with them; and in a word all thy affections runne more to them; than to heavenly things: I cannot ſee then how there can be any colour of excuſe. Now therefore examine thy ſelfe in this, and doe thou deale truely with thy ſelfe, and by that wee may diſcerne a greater ſtreame running for the world, than for God, and ſo a great diſorder in the affections.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, it is an evident character,<note place="margin">Neglect of.</note> that there is an inordinate love going a whoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the world, and of placing our felicity in

them, more than we ſhould doe, and more than we doe in God; when wee can facilitate and further our proſecution of theſe worldly things with a neglect of our duty to God:<note place="margin">Duty to God.</note> when I can neglect my duty to my God, when I can neglect my duty to my owne ſoule;<note place="margin">To our owne ſoule.</note> when I thus runne after the world, that I care not if I doe trample upon God in the way, and trample upon Chriſt in the way, upon my owne ſoule, upon heaven, and all in the way, ſo that I can make ſo much the more ſpeede towards theſe worldly things. This is an evident ſigne that my heart is addicted to them, and that my heart is over-growne with a deſire of them. Marke this, and if thou findeſt, I ſay, that thou canſt diſpenſe with thy duty towards God, or any ſervice of his for the proſecution of thy worldly eſtate; if thou findeſt that thou canſt diſpenſe with thy duty towards thy neighbour, becauſe thou wilt not diminiſh thy eſtate, or that thou canſt diſpenſe with thy duty towards thy owne ſoule, neglect the ſpirituall edification of it, becauſe it doth take thee from the proſecuting of the world; This is an evident ſigne that thy heart runnes out wonderfully inordinatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18414:54"/>
not to be ſo anxious in our ſpirits for them. I ſay, learne hence to abate our actions: not to incumber our ſelves too much with worldly things, doe but as our duty and conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, ſo farre as we are bound by the rule of dutie, to provide for our ſelves and family, do it in duty and inconſcience to God, but doe not over-doe it, doe not too much, trouble not your ſelves about too many things as <hi>Martha</hi> did.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Affections.</note>2.

Abate at leaſt your affections, doe not ſo much eſteeme theſe worldly things, and this world, though you cannot leave it, yet deſpiſe all theſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18414:54"/>
worldly things, and contemne them, and trample them, and have them under our feete, as God hath given them to us, ſo eſteeme them, but as in the <hi>Pſalme</hi> 8. Hee hath put all things under our feete: In reſpect of worldly things, it is true of the godly man; in this ſenſe it is true, I ſay, in regard of Chriſtians, they have them all under their feete; but worldly men have them as a crowne on their head, and they eſteeme it ſo; but indeede it is a burden, that preſſeth them downe, that they cannot ariſe in any noble thoughts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent this, abate your affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe worldly things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Learne to abate your <hi>estimation,</hi>

For ſo long as we nouriſh ſuch an erronious thought, that this is the only happineſſe, Miniſters may talke what they will; they diſparage riches and honour, &amp;c. that have it not themſelves; they diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage pleaſure, that have not beene acquainted with it; but yet when all is done, happineſſe lieth in theſe things. For ſo long as there is ſuch a roote of bitterneſſe within us, ſuch a corrupt opinion, it will not onely overflow like the gall, to imbitter, and poyſon our affections, but alſo our actions; and ſo all things will be diſordered. As in a Watch, if the ſpring wheele be out of frame, all runnes wrong, ſo if this be poyſoned, all will be in danger: The very ſpring of every
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18414:55"/>
thing in a man is a mans judgement, and if that be tainted and corrupted, that will ſoone cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and poyſon our affections, and our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for there is a naturall connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and the intellectuall part is the guiding part of all the reſt; and therefore if you would keepe all the reſt aright, that your actions may be moderate, and your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be moderate, you muſt labour to get, and keepe moderate opinions, moderate your apprehenſions of them; thinke not too highly of them: but rather thinke on theſe things, that may moſt of all diſparage them, and blocke them, and take off the beauty of them, and that glory that is on them, that may dazle our eyes. Learne to abate the world in our proſecution of it, in our actions, in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and in our eſtimations; this is the firſt thing that we may learne from this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this be ſo, then as wee muſt learne to abate what poſſibly wee may, abate our actions,<note place="margin">Tranſlate to better things.</note> affections, and eſtimations of this world: ſo in the ſecond place, let us take a hint from hence, <hi>to tranſlate all theſe, above theſe earthly things,</hi> and ſet them upon thoſe things in which indeede our feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city lieth. If felicitie be not in this world, and if happineſſe be not in theſe worldly things, it is no inconſequent counſell.</p>
               <p>But we have ſhewne, it doth not lie in theſe worldly things; it lies therfore in ſome other,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18414:55"/>
and we have miſtaken the box all this while, and taken <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> as the ſaying is. Then let us tranſlate our affections, which we have ſpilt upon theſe earthly things, and place them upon better things, in which our felicity lyeth: tranſlate them upon <hi>God,</hi> upon <hi>Heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">God. Heaven. Holineſſe.</note> upon <hi>Holineſſe</hi>: theſe are undoubted felicity, and the way unto it.

And therefore I can ſpare them, and be without them, if God doe thinke it fit: I can live well without them I can well afford to want them, ſince I loſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a whit of my felicity by them: It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther annihilated, nor eclipſed by the want of them; let us not therefore be overmuch caſt downe if we want them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Loſſe.</note>2. Let us not be too much caſt downe for the loſſe of them: which is indeed the worſe; O that I had them once, that is a ſad word, to thinke I had them once, but now have loſt them: It is more grievous to be ſtript of what a man had, then ſimply to be naked, to be ſtript of all the injoyment a man had, and tooke ſome pride in, and wherein he thought himſelfe happy, and afterward to be brought to a low ebbe from that, as the Prodigall was, to be brought to the huskes of the Swine; ſo farre degraded from that injoyment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment a man had before, this cuts more deepe, and pierceth the ſoule more grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but yet this conſideration may helpe to mitigate and moderate it, and compoſe our hearts in this caſe: It is true I have loſt, but I have not loſt ſo much of my blood, or my ſpeciall happineſſe: no nor any thing that is eſſentiall, or rituall to it. And may not a man comfort himſelfe in ſuch a caſe as this? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man had beene in travell upon the way,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18414:56"/>
and had met with theeves, and he had ſome looſe money in his pockets, but had in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate place (which the theeves were not aware of) ſome precious jewell, and the theeves ſhould come and take away onely the looſe money, and not finde his jewell, would that man rejoyce or be ſad thinke you, when he is gone from the theeves: would he be ſad and hang downe the head, becauſe he had loſt it may be two or three ſhillings, or rather be thankefull and glad; that he had ſaved his jewell. And ſo it is in this caſe, that man hath no reaſon to be ſad, though he loſt any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, if he loſe not part of his happineſſe. It is not my jewell that I have loſt, it is onely ſomething that did fit looſe about me, a little worldly thing it may be, which was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall with me, but more eaſie to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from me, and ſo without a diminution of happineſſe. This might helpe to compoſe, and to bring the heart in a right frame, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I have loſt ſomthing, but it is but a poore thing, that is not any part of my happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This may teach us to moderate our <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Envy.</note> we are ready to repine at thoſe that have more then we; and when we finde any want in our owne eſtates, we can cavill with God for others; becauſe they are higher, or better then we, therefore God deales unkindly with us, and we begin to repine at this, and many times the heart is ready to miſcarry in ſuch an

eſtate, with ſuch childiſh thoughts. But now this point will rectifie a man, and tell him, he hath no reaſon to envy him for having that which is ſo poore, that it makes not a happy man. Alas poore miſerable man, that hath never ſo much! I thinke with ſad thoughts of him, when I conſider this man is counted a happy man by the world, but yet he is farre from it, being hee is farre from God, I ſhould doe well rather to pray for him, and commiſerate him, then envy ſuch a man, and I ſhould rather ſtudy how to direct him to follow that which is right happineſſe, and that be might not any longer deceive himſelfe, and pleaſe himſelfe with glaſſe, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then pearles.</p>

his happineſſe, rejoyce not in theſe things; but rejoyce, as our Saviour ſaith, in this, that your names are written in the Booke of life. That is, that a Chriſtian ſhould delight in, and rejoyce himſelfe in, and bleſſe God for, and not runne into the ſame exceſſe of riot, in the uſe of theſe worldly things, as worldly men doe, that thinke theſe things a great part of their happineſſe, and thinke to peece out their happineſſe by getting of theſe things.

To be ſo farre from cleaving to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of theſe things,<note place="margin">Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> and having a longing deſire after them. That we ſhould be willing upon this principle, <hi>to communicate thoſe things</hi> that God hath beſtowed upon us, unto others: and not as the Serpent, keepe the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den apples, and neither to eate any our ſelves, nor ſuffer others to eate them: It is an alluſion of a Fable; but yet may have a truth in it, as it hath reference to the Cherubin that keepes the garden of Paradiſe; ſo wee ſhould not hover over our eſtates, and cannot indure any other to come neare them, as the Hen over her chickens, that is ready to flie in the face of thoſe that come neere them: but let us be communicative, our happines doth not conſiſt in the having of them, ſo much as in the uſing of them well, diſpenſing and giving them to others, that is the way by which all theſe worldly things may be conducible to our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe: It is not the meere poſſeſſion of them, but the right uſing of them, that makes them inſtruments of our happineſſe: As the Apoſtle, exhort <hi>rich men not to trust in uncertaine riches,</hi> but to <hi>be fruitfull in good workes</hi>; becauſe, as I ſaid, our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth not depend upon the having of them, but upon the right uſing of them; God
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18414:58"/>
hath made us but diſpenſers, and if wee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our fidelitie in them, wee ſhall advance our happineſſe, but otherwiſe wee ſhall advance our wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As wee may be content to <hi>communicate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Abdicate.</note> ſo alſo to <hi>abdicate</hi> them: Let us be content to be ſo farre from cleaving to thoſe worldly things, that we doe not onely <hi>Collocare,</hi> as the Father ſpeakes, but <hi>projicere,</hi> ſeeing our happineſſe doth not lie in them; let us, I ſay, be contented not onely to communicate them where neceſſitie requireth, but even <hi>projicere</hi> in ſome caſes to caſt out all, as they did, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diſciples in an other caſe, <hi>They came, and did lay downe all their eſtates at the Apoſtles feete.</hi> As ſuppoſe now in times of perſecution, rather to part with all than God, my happineſſe lieth not in them, and I will rather than I will part with God, and with a good conſcience, ſay farewell to all the world, and to all worldly things; my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lieth not in them, but my happineſſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in God and in a good conſcience; I will rather therefore juſtly part with all, yea, and throw away all, rather than part with that which is dearer and better, and more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible towards my happineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the motives, in a word briefely, they are taken</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">His favour.</note>2. And I expreſſe an other part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when I ſay <hi>the favour of God,</hi> here noted by a phraſe that is tropicall enough, and yet I ſhall ſpend time in vaine to open the trope, for I ſuppoſe it is commonly underſtood. <hi>Lifting up the light of his countenance upon us,</hi> is as much, as caſting a favourable aſpect towards and upon us; and being (in a word), gracious and favourable unto us. For as when a man is well pleaſed with any, you know it is one teſtimony of his love, to caſt a ſweet and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenance upon him. <hi>Super omnia vultus Acceſſêre boni,</hi> as he accepted it: the Hoſt was wonderfull carefull and ſolicitous to give the gueſts content, but that which he noted as the principall, was <hi>Super omnia vultus Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſêre boni</hi>: her affable carriage and good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. It is not onely the bleſſings of God which makes us happy, although God ſhould heape many bleſſings upon us, but it is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a good looke from God, that proceedes from a gracious &amp; a loving diſpoſition of God towards us; that puts a price &amp; a beauty upon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18414:61"/>
the bleſſings themſelves. It is an elegant ſtory or obſervation which <hi>Xenophon</hi> tells of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabazus</hi> a great courtier in the Court of <hi>Cyrus</hi>: King <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave him a cup of gold, and there was an other courtier in preſence, that was more intimate, and more neere in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than hee, <hi>viz. Chryſantas</hi>; to whom, though the King gave nothing at that time, yet hee kiſſed him, in token of ſpeciall love; which when he had done, <hi>Artabazus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and wittily ſaid, the cup you gave me was not ſo good gold as the kiſſe you gave <hi>Chryſantas.</hi> It is ſo in this caſe; it is not any gift of God, eſpecially thoſe outward things, that is ſo great a ſigne of Gods favour, as the light of his countenance: A good looke is a ſpeciall teſtimony of his reall affection, which thoſe things are not. For <hi>no man knowes either love or hatred by theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though there might be many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions uſed, yet I conceive this as reall and proper a note, to ſhew wherein our happineſſe in God conſiſts, as any: <hi>viz.</hi> his favour, and good will, and good pleaſure towards us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that comprehends all the reſt, and if we have that, that is it that intereſts us in all the reſt of the excellencies, and the bleſſings of God, hereby they come to be all ours, and wee are intereſted in them all, ſo farre as they may make for our good. Thus of the materiall part.</p>

               <p>So that now, when a man comes to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, that God tranſlates him from the ſtate of ſinne to the ſtate of grace, from being the ſonnes and daughters of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> he ingrafts them into the new <hi>Adam,</hi> bearing his Image, as the ſtate and condition is thus altered, ſo upon this, God lookes on them as friends, <hi>Abraham my friend,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, as in league with him; that there is a combination betweene God, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: why they that are in this condition, they are in the poſſeſſion of God, and of his favour.</p>

A <hi>direct act,</hi> is that intercourſe of favour on Gods part, a <hi>donative</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeake) on Gods part; and <hi>duties</hi> on mans part, when there is a communion maintained betweene God and us, and there is a ſweete intercourſe and fellowſhip betweene God and a mans ſoule.

               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Reflective.</note> But then there is a ſecond thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the fruition of God lies, and that is a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive act,</hi> which (though it be not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the ſtate of happineſſe, for a man may be in the ſtate of happineſſe, and in a good caſe and condition, and yet not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exerciſe it, and put it out in a <hi>reflexive</hi> act) but for the ſweetneſſe, and the taſte of happineſſe, and for the compleate fruition, and injoying of it, it cannot be without this <hi>reflexive</hi> act: that is (that I may in a word tell my meaning by it) when a man doth reflect upon what God hath done for him, and what God hath done by, and in him, and inabled him to doe towards God; and by it he is able to underſtand, and ſee, and take notice that God hath dealt mercifully with him, that hee is Gods, and God is his: and that hee can ſee his owne happineſſe, and ſee his owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo to delight himſelfe, and to joy in God, and in his goodneſſe. In one word, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18414:64"/>
imports no more than to joy in a thing, and to injoy God is one principall thing that makes up the ſweetneſſe (at leaſt) of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; when wee joy in God upon the ſenſe and apprehenſion of a mans owne bleſſed eſtate and condition. For as I have ſaid ſometimes, <hi>Non eſt beatus, eſſe qui ſe non putat,</hi> hee is at leaſt compleatly, and in a ſenſe no happy man, that doth not thinke himſelfe to be ſo, and doth not ſee himſelfe to be a happy man, and doth not take notice of his owne happineſſe. I ſay though it be not of abſolute neceſſitie to the eſſence of happineſſe, yet to the rituall perfecting, and taſting of the ſweetneſſe of happineſſe it is neceſſary. There be many Chriſtians I know that are not able thus to reflect, and ſee their owne face, and condition, though they have a right, and title to happineſſe, and are in a reall communion with God, and doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine directly their duty with God in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yet there may be ſome clouds that keepe off this reflexion, and ſomething that takes them off (at leaſt) from that ſweetneſſe, that they might take in this.

We are now (though joyned to the Lord yet) in ſome reſpect abſent from the Lord, in the land of our pilgrimage here; wherein we have ſome beames, ſome glimpſes, ſome taſtes of the ſweeteneſſe of the light of Gods countenance, though not in full meaſure: But yet ſo, that even thoſe taſtes are ſuch as doe poſſeſſe a man of a true and reall happineſſe, not an imaginary happineſſe, which worldly men have, <hi>viz.</hi> their owne dreames, and fancyes in the poſſeſſion of ſome worldly things, but indeed that which is truely, and eſſencially ſuch, and that which doth deſerve the name of happineſſe, and hath the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and being of it; that a man is in a good eſtate, for the maine ſubſtance, though ſhort in the degrees: God is ſo great a good, that even the injoying of him in ſuch a manner as is poſſible for us here in this life, in this vaile of teares, in this abſence from God; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of him here by faith, and thoſe taſtes that wee have of him, is enough to elevate, and raiſe our condition to a ſtate of true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then as a lower communion with God, ſuch as we have by faith here, doth bring a man to true and reall happineſſe: ſo when we ſhall be exalted to a higher degree, and a more neere, and excellent communion with

God in heaven by ſight, wee ſhall attaine the royall and perfect happineſſe, when we ſhall ſee him face to face: Not in that rigid ſenſe, or notion, that the Schoole men have ſo much written of, as though all a mans happineſſe lay meerely in beholding of the very eſſence of God, which is neither poſſible for us here, nor in another life (I ſay) to behold Gods eſſence: and they themſelves (as who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is acquainted with them, muſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confeſſe, if he will ſpeake the truth) doe exceedingly fumble in the buſineſſe, when they come to it, and they are troubled very much how to accommodate one difficulty: <hi>viz.</hi> How a man can poſſibly comprehend the very eſſence and quiddity of God, and yet not comprehend him, and in my opinion, it is an inexplicable difficulty: And it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any nature created, not onely for us men, but for the very Cherubins in the ſtate of glory to comprehend the very eſſence of God, ſo as it is diſtinguiſhed from his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, for the truth is, there is no proportion at all betweene a thing that is finite, and a thing that is infinite, and therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that our finiteneſſe ſhould not onely be able to comprehend, but apprehend the intrinſecall eſſence of God. Neither is this altogether the onely thing, although it be a ſpeciall thing that makes up our happineſſe: Our happineſſe doth not conſiſt in being all

But it is no wonder for men to advance their owne art, and for thoſe to ſpeake ſo highly of contemplation, who have placed al in contemplation. But this only by the way.</p>
               <p>(There is one thing more which I ſhall adde but in a word) God, I ſay, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is a mans happineſſe in every degree of happineſſe, according to our degree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, the lower conjunction, by faith in this life, being a true and reall happineſſe: and the higher conjunction with God by ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perfect, and royall happineſſe, the top of all that which our nature is capable of.</p>

many places of Scripture in this caſe, in an eſpeciall reſpect; Becauſe it is the whole ſcope, and ſumme of all the Scripture, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God unto us in this excellency of being, and in this relation to our happineſſe; that it is him alone that can doe it.

               <p n="1">1. By <hi>Teſtimony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you will but remember that charge, and direction that God giveth by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Prieſts, how they ſhould bleſſe the people of God. <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.25. and ſo following.

For this were not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient intimation of bleſſing conveighed unto the people, if there were not contained (all the bleſſings neceſſary to happineſſe) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the bleſſing. And here is nothing expreſſed, but God and his favour, the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his countenance, and that is that one,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18414:68"/>
in which is comprehended all bleſſings, and all happineſſe.</p>
               <p>And the very ſame thing may be obſerved out of that <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>ſalutation,</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles uſed frequently, <hi>Paul</hi> eſpecially in all his Epiſtles: <hi>Grace and peace be multiplyed unto you.</hi> To omit all other variety of expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by the <hi>grace of God,</hi> is intimated Gods love and favour, for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifies principally, that; I know it hath ſome other ſignification; but the moſt originall and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſignification of grace is the favour, and good pleaſure of God, which hee caſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a man: That is, that which is ſet in the front, as the very ſpring, and fountaine of all bleſſings, out of which it iſſueth, and in which it is contained. <hi>Peace,</hi> was formerly the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Hebrewes: and they intended to comprehend under it all bleſſings, becauſe peace is the mother of many: and the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were wont to paint Peace in the forme of a woman, with a horne of plenty in her hands, all bleſſings: And indeed peace is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full great bleſſing; and they were wont to comprehend by it, as a principall thing, all bleſſings, and all good: when they wiſhed peace unto them. And indeed take peace in the latitude, and it fully comprehends all, <hi>peace with God,</hi> and <hi>peace with a mans owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> beſides all other things, that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by it. Now the Apoſtle addes in the

New Teſtament grace, to peace. <hi>Grace and Peace, &amp;c.</hi> As implying that that is the very ſpring and head of all peace, and of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: There be abundance of expreſſions in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> which doe pregnantly ſet out this truth unto us. That in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord which I will require, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold his beauty; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in his Temple:</hi> Some interpreters vary concerning what the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> aimes at; I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thus much in a generality, which is cleare, that he meanes a communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God: which is that one thing, which if a Chriſtian had, he needes deſire no more: That we ſhould all deſire and deſire againe, and be in love with, and that is enough even to ſatisfie us, the fruition of God; and the beholding of him in his Ordinances, in his Temple, to have correſpondency and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and communion with him there. O God vouchſafe us that! Now this is ſo infinitely ſweete, that it was the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> onely deſire, and the ſumme of all his deſires here, and therefore much more in the Tabernacle of Heaven, which doth make up the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and compleateneſſe of all our happineſſe. And ſo in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.7. <hi>O how excellent is thy loving kindneſſe, O Lord! Therefore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men put their trust under the ſhaddow of thy wings: they ſhall be abundantly ſatisfyed,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18414:69"/>
&amp;c.</hi> All is placed in God, as if we could but get our ſhare of God, get him, and then all happineſſe is gotten. But more plainely in words to our purpoſe in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whom thou chuſeſt and cauſeſt to approach to thee, &amp;c.</hi> would you know who is the bleſſed man, and what is that thing that makes a man bleſſed? It is he that God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that is happy; it is Gods love and favour that makes happy, and our conjunction too, and communion with him. And that place that I mentioned before in the former point, in <hi>Pſalme</hi> 144.15. <hi>Bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe:</hi> But then hee corrects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it is not the ſheepe and the Oxen, nor the ſonnes and daughters, nor all things going merrily with them in this ſtate and condition of life: He corrects himſelfe there. But this is the happineſſe, <hi>Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord:</hi> They that are in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and covenant with him, there is the maine thing in which our happineſſe, and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lies.</p>

To omit all others, there be two excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18414:69"/>
in Scripture that preſent this truth unto us.</p>
               <p>That ſame in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6, 7. of <hi>David</hi> being wonderfully diſtreſſed, <hi>the people</hi> (ſaith the ſtory) <hi>whiſpered of ſtoning him:</hi> He had loſt before, his wife, and children, and his eſtate, and all his people were at this loſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that were among his troopes began to mutiny, yea even thoſe that were his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers thought to ſtone him: but yet (the Text ſaith) <hi>David comforted himſelfe in the Lord his God.</hi> It was that which ſtayed him, and ſupported him, and furniſhed him with comfort in that great diſtreſſe, he being able to ſee his conjunction with God. For there is a double degree of comfort. There is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of comfort in heaven, when there is the conſummation of happineſſe. And there is a lower degree of it here, which ſometime is called a conſolation; ſuch as may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to comfort us here, and to make us hold up our heads here, and that when all the creatures faile, and are all withered and blaſted, even here God affords this to <hi>David,</hi> in his greateſt diſtreſſe and extremity.</p>
               <p>And that which I have ſometime treated on, that excellent place in <hi>Habbac.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The figge tree ſhall not bloſſome; neither ſhall fruite be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall faile, &amp;c.</hi> But yet though all theſe things faile and decay, <hi>I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly joy in the God of my ſalvation:</hi> which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18414:70"/>
implies thus much; that God is ſo excellent a good, that they that keepe their hold in him, and keepe cloſe to him, it ſhall be a ſpring of comfort, a fountaine of happineſſe unto him in the middeſt of all adverſity; when all things deſert, and forſake a man, and will afford a man no happineſſe at all, this ſhall. Now briefely in a word, further for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the point, for I will not dilate in any, but ſhall deſire to paſſe over all things in as compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a way as I may, becauſe I would finiſh the point.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Experience of the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.</note>2. Beſides the <hi>teſtimonies</hi> in Scripture, it may be made more legible, and viſible, by conſidering the <hi>experience of the faithfull,</hi> and of the Saints of God in all ages. For as for thoſe that are ſtrangers to God, that never taſted how good and gracious God is: and have not their eyes opened to ſee the beauty and the excellency that is in God, they may heare all this diſcourſe it may be as a tale, and ſtrange thing, that a man that hath nothing but God alone, yet ſhould be ſaid to be a happy man, it ſeemes very uncouth to them, and they heare it, and ſmacke a little at it perchance; but they underſtand it not, nor finde any rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in it; but the ſoule that is Gods, all that are godly, that have had this conjunction with God, and this communion with him, may come in to teſtifie and verifie this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:18414:70"/>Some more <hi>ſingularly,</hi> as the Martyrs,<note place="margin">Singular.</note> which have willingly ſuffered the loſſe of all things, and yet ſuffered nothing in their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; but ſo farre have beene elevated and raiſed with the apprehenſion of this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with God, and fruition of him, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the moſt bitter things, that could be laid on them, could make no print in them: They laid downe their bodies with as much willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and chearefullneſſe, when they were to dye for the name of Chriſt, as we lay off our cloathes when wee goe to bed, as a Father ſpeakes.<note place="margin">Particular.</note> And in many particulars which I could bring (if I had time and did intend it) I could excellently make plaine this truth. That of <hi>Theodoret</hi> (to name no more) that found ſo much ſweeteneſſe in this, even when he was on the racke, in the midſt of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he did not finde any anguiſh in his torments, but a great deale of pleaſure: and when they tooke him downe from the racke, complained that they did him wrong in taking him downe, and in ceaſing to torment him: For, ſaid he, all the while that I was on the racke, and you venting your mallice againſt me, me thought there was a young man in white, an Angell ſtood by me, which wiped off the ſweate, and I found a great deale of ſweetneſſe in it, which now I have loſt.</p>
               <p>In this experience we may ſee it cleare, and evident, that God needes not the helpe of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18414:71"/>
any other thing, here was nothing in the world, to give any ſenſe or taſte of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unto poore <hi>Theodoret</hi>; but it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
it was meerely a conveighance of Gods owne ſpirit and himſelfe, unto his ſpirit and ſoule; that ſupported him infinitely, and made his paines ſweeter then his caſe, and more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to him. And I know there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that hath had communion with God, but in ſome degree, or other, hath the ſame experience; eſpecially when God doth make his comforts moſt ſweete, and the ſenſe of their happineſſe at the higheſt; It may be when their outward condition is at the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. A cleare experiment to proove, that what God doth by the creature, he can doe without. The comforts that lye ſcattered in them, are all concentred in him, and he can conveigh them in the middeſt of the want of all.</p>

As the Sunne cannot bee beheld, not becauſe it is too obſcure, but becauſe it is too light, <hi>Excellens ſenſibile deſtruit ſenſum.</hi> The object is too ſtrong; it is ſo glorious an object that our eyes are too weake to looke fully upon it. Now the two other wayes come in, and ſubordinately helpe out that; becauſe God hath manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to our capacity, by his workes of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and providence, which is the onely way that God manifeſts himſelfe in nature, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very workemanſhip, in every worke of his: As the ſaying is, the meaneſt creature hath <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid Dei,</hi> and the beſt creature hath <hi>aliquid nihili.</hi> Every creature is a compound of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and imperfection; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly exactly manifeſt God. But there muſt be the two other wayes to ſupply it, and make up that manifeſtation, by which the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18414:73"/>
ſoule may be reduced to the underſtanding of God, by his workes.</p>
               <p>The two other come in, I ſay as wayes to ſupply it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, all the excellencies that be in the creatures, are ſuppoſed to be in God that did make them. It is impoſſible, as the ſaying is, that <hi>ullus daret quod in ſe non habet.</hi> It is impoſſible that a man ſhould give that to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is not in himſelfe, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there ſhould be any good, or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in the creature, but that it muſt be in the Creator, and that in a tranſcendent manner: which is the ſecond way <hi>Via eminentiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe every creature hath <hi>aliquid ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hili</hi> in him, that is his imperfection, by which he comes ſhort of God, and will not be full: we muſt make it up with the other ſupply, and that is the third thing, <hi>Via negationis:</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all the imperfections, and ſetting them all aſide, as the concomitants of the creature, for God cannot ſee the creature, but with ſome deficiency which he is free from. And therefore this followes as another way, I ſay <hi>Via negationis,</hi> God hath not theſe and theſe imperfections. But now to apply all this and bring it home to my preſent purpoſe; As God may bee knowne theſe wayes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So in <hi>ſpeciall,</hi> he may be knowne to be, and is our happineſſe, and can bee our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18414:73"/>
all theſe wayes even alone.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He can be our happineſſe, and is our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, <hi>Via cauſalitatis,</hi> God is omnipotent, and ſo if there be any thing that is neceſſary, or conducible for our comfort, or happineſſe, it is all in his <hi>power</hi> to give, and ſo can be our happineſſe. If creatures be neceſſary (and ſo farre as they be neceſſary) if we have God wee are in the moſt certaine way of having theſe and all other things. For all lye in God as a Fountaine and ſpring of all. Suppoſe there be a neceſſity, that a man cannot be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi> meerely happy, in the <hi>fruition of God, formally</hi>; becauſe man is a compound creature, a body as well as a ſoule: yet God alone may be ſufficient, becauſe all is in him <hi>caſually,</hi> he can produce and command all other good, and all other creatures, as being Lord over all, if we want fire, or cloathes to warme us, and keepe us from the cold; though for the preſent wee have not thoſe, yet God can bring fire and cloathes, and command all the creatures to waite upon us, and ſerve our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. So that if a man have nothing, yet in having God hee hath all; beſides hee hath the Lord of all; which can with a word, or a nodde, an intimation command not onely the creatures that are, but create creatures anew, if hee would; If the whole world now extant were not able to doe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians good; God were able to create another
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18414:74"/>
world for their good: and furniſh it with all creatures ſufficiently to doe them good. As ſuppoſe a Chriſtian were ſicke of ſome new diſeaſe, that all the world had not a medicine for it; yet God can command one, or make a new medicine; becauſe all things are at his diſpoſing, So that if we have God, we have all in the caſe, and ſo an all ſufficient good in God alone, and an all-ſufficiency of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is all <hi>via eminentiae,</hi> being able to ſupply the want of any creature; as hee can bring all the creatures to us, and give them us, which are neceſſary for our good, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: ſo he is able by way of eminency to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect of them, though he bring them not, he can doe it by himſelfe; and which is moſt of all, he can give us that, without which nothing can be good for us; that is, ſet our ſpirits, and hearts in a right frame; which if they were not, they would ſpoile all we have, and they would make them rather an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our miſery, then any addition to our happineſſe. God onely is able to make a man ſo that he may be a fit ſubject of happineſſe, and capable of it; being inlightened in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and rectifyed in his will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, whereby hee is able to eſteeme of things, and love things as hee ought, and to uſe them accordingly. So that whatſoever good may reſult from the creature for our
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18414:74"/>
good, if we have God, we have it. For we have the Spring, and Fountaine, and Mint, in which he can caſt all other good for us. For this is a certaine rule in Divinity, that God cannot doe any thing by the creature, but he can doe the ſame without the creature. Nay more then ſo, the creature (although preſent) cannot doe any thing without the aſſiſtance of God; but he himſelfe can doe it though no creature be preſent. Yea God is ſo eminent a good, that he containes the tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of every creature: For let any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be wanting, as fire to warme us, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to waſh us, yet God can ſupply that defect; he can doe it by himſelfe, becauſe all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of every creature is tranſcendently in God. He hath power to ſuſpend the action of the creature, and take off the bleſſing: and on the other ſide, God can ſupply the want of the creature, by a hidden way of his owne bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. He can make a little to goe a great way, yea without all, as well as with all, hee can make a man happy. He is an equivalent good to make ſatisfaction for al, and ſo in this reſpect he can be our happines, and bring us to happines.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Via negationis.</hi> God alone can bee our happineſſe, becauſe there is no defect in him. He is a rocke in time of need; he can doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any creature, or all can doe for us; nay more, for if wee had all the creatures, they would be all defective, but there is no defect
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18414:75"/>
in God; As ſuppoſe if in ſickneſſe there were ſuch a medecine, which if I could get, it, may be it would doe ſome good: Now God, hee can doe that alone himſelfe, which any, or all creatures could doe, nay and above, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that every one of the creatures can doe. Becauſe every creature is defective, and too ſhort, but God, he hath all excellencies without any mixture of imperfection. In a word, God is All-ſufficient, as in the tenor of the covenant with <hi>Abraham, Walke before me and be upright, I am God All-ſufficient.</hi> He is All-ſufficient, that you cannot name what you would have, but he is that, As the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins had a conceite of Manna, that it had that taſte in every mans mouth, that every man deſired: I am ſure it is ſo of God: Or as ſome men that have a mind at ſome diſhes of meate, they can finde all the dainties in the world in that diſh which likes them; as ſuppoſe Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and Partridg, &amp; Capon they find al in that diſh; It is moſt certainly and really true of God, not in conceit onely; Hee that knowes what God is, if he have God, he can finde all good in him, all the excellencies of all the creatures are compendiouſly, and ſummarily compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in God. Now hee that is All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, there can bee nothing wanting in him to make perfectly happy, even by himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But now to ſpeake a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18414:75"/>
There are but three things that I ſhall deſire you to conſider, and no doubt but out of every one of them will reſult a ſtrong and cleare proofe of this truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider the <hi>particular perfections which are in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider the <hi>proportion</hi> they have with our nature to ſupply our wants.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, conſider the <hi>neereneſſe of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and communion,</hi> which we may have with God, that ſo we may be intereſted in his perfections.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, the <hi>particular perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God</hi>: In a word to name no more but the maine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>power of God,</hi> and his omnipotency.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>wiſedome of God,</hi> and his omniſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>goodneſſe and grace of God,</hi> which is infinitely tranſcendent, and hath the crowne of all the attributes of glory. For when the Lord told <hi>Moſes</hi> he would ſhew him all his goodneſſe, hee ſet himſelfe out in the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of grace and mercy. But yet a little more particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>power in God,</hi> by which he is able to ſupply all things whatſoever, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will. There is nothing but his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency can reach; And for a man to have him to be his friend, that is Lord of all, in whoſe hands is the diſpoſing of all, he cannot
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18414:76"/>
but thinke himſelfe happy, having the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch a friend.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Wiſedome.</note>2. <hi>All wiſedome</hi> is his. If he knew not our wants, but were ignorant of them, though he had all power, it were nothing, and hee had need to be put in minde to ſhew it. But now he knowes our ſtate, and condition; and he doth know all the wayes, by which it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupply our neceſſities.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Good will.</note>3. But yet neither of theſe were any thing, though he had power and wiſedome, yet if he did want <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> this would little relieve a man, and ſtand him in ſtead. Therefore we added in the third place, the excellency of goodneſſe. He is the fountaine of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all proceeds from himſelfe; he is the Originall of it, and he lookes not for any riſe from us.</p>
               <p>Now to have God in whom there is ſuch a concurrence of all theſe; that hath all power to helpe me in all caſes; that there is nothing can come without the ſphere of his activity, beyond his power. That hath all wiſedome, to take notice of all my wants, and knowes all the wayes to ſupply them. And beyond all theſe, having intelligible goodneſſe, ſuch bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of compaſſion, that it is not poſſible, but he ſhould uſe his power, and ſet out his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, rather then thoſe that he hath taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to covenant ſhall not be ſupplyed. Who would not eaſily apprehend out of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18414:76"/>
and fruition of God, ſuch a friend as he is, needs no more, all being in his power. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a man had among men ſuch a friend, ſuppoſe a King, who were wiſe, and did know in what ſtate and condition hee were: And had ſuch power, and dominion, that he could command any thing, that were neceſſary for the ſupply of his honour, or advancement; And withall, had ſuch an ingagement upon him in affection, and good will, might not this aſſure a man, that this were better then many pennies in a mans purſe, then the poſſeſſion of many other things, nay although he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all other things, yet the favour of ſuch a man would fetch in all other things. Such a friend is God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This would not be our good,<note place="margin">Proportion</note> except there were ſome <hi>proportion</hi> in our nature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. It is not in God, in all thoſe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to make us happy, unleſſe we be capable of happineſſe: But now therefore conſider that man being created according to Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, he is capable of it, and it is ſutable and competible with him, as Gods ſervants good. His ſoule may looke upon this ſociety, and fellowſhip that he hath with God, hee is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive what a rich treaſure it is. How much it is more worth then tenne thouſand Mines of Gold, to be able to ſay, God is mine: he is apprehenſive of it, and hee ſeeth no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but this may be compleate happineſſe to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18414:77"/>
him and therefore he delights in it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himſelfe with it. As he did ſometime, hee was a great Courtier in King <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Court, and one in favour with him, he was to beſtow his Daughter in marriage, to a very great man, and of himſelfe hee had no great meanes, and therefore one ſaid to him O Sir, Where will you have meanes to beſtow a dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie upon your Daughter, proportionable to her degree? where is your riches? Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, what need I care, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is my friend. But may not wee ſay much more <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where the Lord is our friend, that hath thoſe excellent and glorious attributes, that cannot come ſhort in any wants, or to make us happy, eſpecially wee being capable of it, and made proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the degrees of communion and conjunction betweene God and thoſe that are his, He is ſo intimate, that hee can conveigh himſelfe; he can drop his owne influence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule of a man, and ſweeten a mans very ſpirits within him, and heighten and elevate them. Whereas all other creatures ſtand without a man, and cannot reach ſo farre, but in him we live and moove and have our being. To omit all other expreſſions, of the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God and the ſoule. It is the moſt <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate conjunction</hi> that can be. And therefore the fitteſt to conveigh an infinite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18414:77"/>
happineſſe. And as it is the moſt intimate conjunction; ſo it is the moſt <hi>indiſſoluble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</hi> The bond can never be untyed again, if the match be once made betweene God, and t he ſoule of a man, that muſt continue, which is the excellency of happineſſe. For this is one maine part of happineſſe that it ſhall never be loſt. And therefore where there is ſuch riches in God, and ſuch All ſufficiency, as appeares in the particular attributes before mentioned: and ſuch as wee are capable of, as are within the ſphere of our natures capacity; and ſo may be our good. For nothing will make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, but what is <hi>bonum congruum.</hi> And where wee may come to have ſufficient conjunction with it, an intimate, and ſtrong conjunction, and indiſſoluble and inſeparable. And all this being in God; there can be no hinderance but that God alone may, nay God alone is the ſpring of all our happineſſe; and ſo the point is cleare. That God alone can make a man truely and perfectly happy; give us the reall and the royall happineſſe.</p>

A thing I confeſſe, which I mentioned by way of inſtruction out of the former point, as ſometimes it fals out, that I have occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame things, out of different principals. But yet let no man thinke it is ſuperfluous; for, for the moſt part, thoſe conſequencies which flow out of many things, and are ſo often ſpoken of, are (for the moſt part, I ſay) of frequent uſe: and therefore if they be iterated it cannot be unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: as we ſee it, there be ſome things that are more neceſſarie than others, and we are not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of uſing them often, nay alwayes: and ſome things though neceſſary, yet if we uſe them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, we ſhould grow wearie of them; as now if we uſe Beefe, and Mutton, or any one ſuch thing, (though theſe are the beſt wee can hold longeſt with) yet if we uſe them alwayes, the ſtomack would be cloied, and we ſhould grow wearie of them. But yet Bread we are not wearie of, though we uſe it alwaies: nor drinke we are not wearie of uſing alwayes: what ever other cates or dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we have, yet theſe are common concommi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of all our eatings and feaſts.

We ſee the Stars; although we ſee them ſometimes in a puddle, in the bottome of a Well, nay in a ſtinking Ditch: yet the Starres (although they reflect there) have their ſituation in the Heaven: So it may be with a godly man; we may ſee him in a miſerable condition, in a low condition for theſe worldly things; but yet for all

that, hee is fixed in the region of happineſſe: ſo long as they retaine the poſſeſſion of God, and the fruition of him; that God ownes them; and that they have commerce with him, and communion with him; It cannot be, but that he that thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of God, muſt partake alſo of happineſſe.

two other things which the legall covenant was ignorant of, and that is,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Faith in Chriſt,</hi> that what I come ſhort of in my owne performance, and ſo could not ſatisfie the Law or God, and the Juſtice of God, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe out of my ſelfe to finde it in another, and lay my confidence on another, who hath paid the price for my happineſſe, and made up what was wanting in me: obedience is now ſupplied by faith which is evangelicall, and which the law knew not of before.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Obedience</hi> is now made up by <hi>repentance,</hi> that though a man doth not keepe a conſtant tenour of exact and rigourous obedience, yet there comes in a ſupplie of that in another evangelicall way, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it whole by repentance, by ſorrowing and mourning for thoſe failings, and walking humbly before God, the ſame obedience is required as much as before, but the rigour is not exacted: but God is pleaſed to accept of repentance ſuch as may proceed from faith, ſo that now our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is ſupplied by repentance, for out failings in the exactneſſe of it: Now I ſpeak of theſe things only as things to bee knowne and believed, the the ſumme as leaſt of Gods covenant, by which he is pleaſed to diſpenſe happineſſe to us, in what way, and what he requires at our hands towards the attaining of it, before he will beſtow it upon us: there muſt bee ſome good degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things, but yet this is not all the ground-worke laid towards happineſſe.<note place="margin">Commends by,</note>

commands</hi> in the ſubſtance of the covenant, but how God commends this covenant unto us, and how he ratifieth it,</p>
               <p n="1">1 By <hi>menaces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Menaces.</note> in which we know the ſanctions and threatnings of wrath, upon our breach and neglect of what God requires of us in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Now leſt there ſhould bee any thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the branch of knowledge,<note place="margin">Divine things.</note> I adde this to make a ſupply of it: only to mention it therefore and ſo to paſſe; There muſt be the knowledge of <hi>Divine</hi> things.</p>
               <p>The knowledge of God in his nature and in his will, and of divine things that pertaine to theſe, that have a neceſſary connexion with theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Faith in God:<note place="margin">Faith aſſent.</note> there muſt bee a liking in the underſtanding: a man hath an apprehenſion of theſe things, but a bare apprehenſion of theſe things is not ſufficient, but it muſt bee an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and knowledge joyned with <hi>faith</hi>; believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſenting to thoſe things wee doe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: a man may know ſomething (ſuppoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

heaven) that another man may tell him, but hee may believe it no more than a fable; or hee may be able to diſcourſe and deſcribe it as well as another, but if ſo be a man yeelds an aſſent or beliefe unto it, ſo as he conceives a realitie in the thing, and a ſubſtance, ſo as it is not fabular and imaginary, but reall, this is faith: when the mind of man cloſeth, and aſſenteth, and conſenteth unto it: I meane no more here by faith then an <hi>aſſent,</hi> though I know it comprehends more then this, which is the reaſon of the miſtake of many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and of the diverſitie of opinions that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and ſo of their contradictions one of another; I ſay, the not cleare obſerving of the uſe of the word: but every one underſtands the word in his owne ſenſe, and ſo takes up opinions according to his owne mind, and ſo makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, which oftentimes, are about matter of words: now I ſay, faith comprehends not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the act of the underſtanding, but the act of the will too, ſo as the will doth imbrace and adhere and cleave to thoſe truths, which the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceives: and not only imbracing meerely by the aſſent to the truth of it, but by cloſing with the good of it, taſting and reliſhing it: as faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not only the aſſenting of a mans mind that <hi>Christ</hi> is the Saviour, but a reſultancie of the will on <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Saviour, embracing of him, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, eſteeming, and honouring him as a Saviour: the Scripture comprehends both theſe together, and there is a rule for it, which the Rabbins give for the opening of the Scripture, <hi>viz. verba ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18414:94"/>
etiam denotant affectus:</hi> words in the Scripture which ſeeme too imply matter of underſtanding only, import alſo matter of affection: as in that place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is eternall life to know thee, &amp;c.</hi> It is not bare knowledge the Scripture means there, but knowledge joyned with affections: And ſo in the <hi>Pſalme</hi> 1.6. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the godly, &amp;c.</hi> It is not a bare knowledge only, for then there were no more ſaid of them, then of the wicked; but it is meant of a knowledge peculiar to the godly, and therefore it is not a bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for <hi>the way of the wicked ſhall periſh,</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee knowes the one with approbation of, and delighting in his wayes: and that is the meaning.</p>
               <p>So that now to draw up this, there be two things to make up this faith, this believing, this aſſent, for I go no farther here.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There is a <hi>cloſing with a Divine truth,<note place="margin">To Gods truth</note> with a truth of God,</hi> for faith cannot be extended beyond this branch, in this Theologicall ſenſe wee now ſpeake of, it is true, there is a humane faith, which embraceth and looketh on a humane truth, but this <hi>Divine faith</hi> which is neceſſarie to ſalvation, and the way to happineſſe reſpecteth only divine truths of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It implies not only the <hi>materiall object,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">On Gods word.</note> which faith lookes on, but alſo the formall <hi>reſpect,</hi> which induceth a man, and that is the <hi>teſtimonie of God,</hi> ſo that there is an aſſenting to a truth of God, for a divine teſtimonies, for Gods words ſake: And now joyne both theſe together, and they will both
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18414:95"/>
concurre together in the way to happineſſe: All the knowledge wee have here in this life is but a knowledge of faith, ſuch a knowledge as is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded altogether on the teſtimonie of thoſe divine truths, which God hath revealed unto us, and not founded on any evidence or demonſtration of Scripture, for all the ſtreſſe of it lyeth on the ſtreſſe of divine revelation.</p>

               <p>I do not intend ſo much concerning the former, as concerning the later, yet ſomething I will ſpeak briefly of either.</p>

ſalvation: and that I mainly intend, knowledge in things that are abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation:<note place="margin">Abſolutely.</note> Now it is a very hard thing, and Divines have been at a long ſtand about it, and much puzled in it, how to circumſcribe or innumerate, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, what things, and how many are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be knowne to ſalvation, which it a man know not, he is out of the way to ſalvation, and not in a poſſibilitie of ſalvation, I ſay, it is a very hard thing to doe this in particular, to goe and point out every one that is neceſſary to ſalvation abſolutely: but I conceive this to bee neither a materiall nor ſatisfactorie way, there be ſome things which God hath required of abſolute neceſſity to be known, as that <hi>without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> or to come to attaine ſalvation, and I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all to that, namely, <hi>to all thoſe truths of God, which if a man know not, hee is not able to produce and act a ſaving faith:</hi> ſo that he may rightly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially lay hold on the Lord <hi>Ieſus chriſt:</hi> all arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of knowledge without which this cannot bee done abſolutely, theſe and theſe alone, (no other things) are abſolutely neceſſary to bee knowne under pain of damnation, and loſſe of ſalvation: nothing I ſay but thoſe truths, which alone if I do know, I may be enabled and put in a competent ſtate to produce a reall act of faith in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> if I do know that I am <hi>ſalvabilis,</hi> if I have ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as to light me to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the ſtarre did the Wiſemen, ſo much knowledge as this, that will ſufficiently and ſafely lead me to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo that I may be really united to, and incorporated in <hi>Chriſt,</hi>

ſo much knowledge is abſolutely neceſſarie, and who ever hath, or hath not, is, or is not, in a way to, and a ſtate of ſalvation: there is no knowledge but this abſolutely neceſſary, <hi>neceſsitate medii,</hi> to grow and increaſe in: many things, as in regard of our place and the like is neceſſarie to bee known, <hi>neceſsitate praecepti,</hi> but not abſolutely neceſſarie as choſe principalls are that doe belong to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and doe leade and inable a man to the exerciſing of a lively act of faith in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Then knowledge is ſound, and ſo faith when it reacheth in regard of the matter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion to all thoſe things that are neceſſarie, and wants nothing that is neceſſarie, but reacheth and comprehends all that is neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>

               <p>Firſt, it is a <hi>ſubſtantiall knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Subſtantiall penetrative.</note> that is a ſolid knowledge: a man may have a ſuperficiall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome divine truths, which is ſo farre from ſinking into the heart, that it doth not ſoake into the braine, but only ſwimes on it: a man may have a little darke, and obſcure glimmering of things, but they cannot ſinke in deeply, nor are ſolid, whereby hee may apprehend and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the depth of them: Now ſuch a knowledge as that is a man may have, and it may bee no way beneficiall to him, doe him no good, nor be any way uſefull to him towards the way to happineſſe

and ſalvation: ſuch a fleetie ſwimming knowledge a man may have, but 'tis not ſolid, unleſſe it bee ſubſtantiall.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Effectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</note>Secondly, as it is ſubſtantiall, ſo it is <hi>effectuall:</hi> and if this be defective I cannot conceive it to bee ſolid: for as for my owne part, I could never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that which Divines have gone about, to be able to put a characteriſticall difference in the nature Of knowledge, that a man may bee able to ſay ſuch a knowledge is, and ſuch a knowledge is not a ſaving knowledge, but only as I uſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it in this ſimilitude (which ſeemes very fit) in the ſunne: the Sunn is the moſt glorious bodie which is in the heavens, but the Moone hath the next degree to the Sunn in appearance, yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of art, many ſtarres exceed the ſunne in magnitude, but the Moone hath only the advantage of neereneſſe to the earth, which doth make it appeare ſo great: but yet though the Sun be the more glorious light, and the Moone ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a faint, and weake light, which a man may behold, whereas hee cannot the Sunne: yet this light of the Moone hath this peculiar propertie, which he doth more than the Sunne (I ſpeake by way of ſuppoſition) the reciprocall ebbing and flowing of the Sea depends on the change of the Moone, and the Moone which is the weaker light, hath a peculiar propertie in regard of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on thoſe bodies that are humid, ſo as that all watry bodies here below depend more on the light of the Moone, then on the light of the Sunne: Now to apply the compariſon, for I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18414:97"/>
ſtand not much to confirme or deny much the philoſophicall diſtinctions; There may be as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent light which may not be ſaving, for I cannot difference it in light: a wicked man may be a great Rabbine, and underſtand Divine things with a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eye like the Sunne; and there is no characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticall difference in it, but it is the influence of it on thoſe lower bodies, as the Moone hath the greater influence, though it be the weaker light: So knowledge let it be what it will, if it be good and ſaving, it hath an influence on the ſoule. There may bee a great deale of knowledge which is not vitall and practicall; which carrieth not the heart and affections along with it, and they that have it, have not ſaving knowledge, but they that have the leaſt degree of knowledge, ſo it bee ſuch as hath an influence to draw the heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections along with it, to love God, and obey God, though it bee I ſay in a leſſer degree, and a weaker light, yet it is indeed, ſolid and ſaving knowledge: ſuch a knowledge as that, which I can ſay it is a ſubſtantiall and a penetrative know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it doth not ſwim in the braine, but that it doth comprehend thoſe things, not only ſlabber them over, but it is officiall and operative, and that indeed is the moſt characteriſticall and intrinſecall difference, and it is that which is indeed ſaving knowledge, whether it bee in a greater or leſſer meaſure, ſo it be operative and effectuall on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions of men: this is the firſt thing in the explication, and belongs to the firſt branch <hi>viz. of underſtanding,</hi> which comprehends know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and beliefe.</p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:18414:105"/>So that I conceive of all theſe the maine thing and the principall, is the right ſetting of the heart and affections on God, that is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, though every one of them in their ſeverall kindes are neceſſarie, knowledge as leaves, and actions as fruits in their ſeaſon; theſe are ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie too, that I would rather decline compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, but yet when I come to make the moſt exact ſearch and tryall, eſpecially of living; the beſt way is to feele the pulſe of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they are the moſt certaine ſigne of life. And this is the firſt thing I deſire to adde to all the particulars, in a generall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there muſt bee all had; both <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Affections,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> all are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>

               <p n="2">2 <hi>The ſumme of all religion,</hi>

to be done: yet theſe three may be circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the other two: the affections may bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the matter of knowledge according to the uſe of Scripture, for that knowledge the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture accounts as no knowledge, that doth not carry along with it ſutable affections, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rule is, <hi>Verba ſenſus denotant affectus</hi>: or elſe affections may bee comprehended under the practicall part, things to bee done, for there is not only the thing to be done, but the manner of the doing of that thing, as out of holy affections: for that is one of the principall praiſes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it lyeth in the right regulating of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ſetting of them aright: So that I ſay this diſtribution into theſe, that Religion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends and teacheth no more but theſe three, nothing but the right knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>And the right affections we ought to have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
               <p>And the right actions and obedience that wee ought to exhibit unto God; All is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under theſe three, and it comes to the ſame effect if it be laid down in theſe two.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18414:108"/>
doe produce fruitfulneſſe, holy actions and obedience.</p>
               <p>And then againe for the other two, <hi>feare and love,</hi> happineſſe is aſcribed to either of them: tho to adde this caution by the way: the old Teſtament ſpeakes more often in the language, of <hi>feare,</hi> and the new Teſtament in the language of <hi>love,</hi> as in the <hi>Prov,</hi> 1.7. <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdome,</hi> wiſdome as you ſhall ſee in every place, is ſet out as the ladder to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the feare of the Lord, is the firſt ſtep in that ladder:<note place="margin">

               <p>And it is aſcribed to <hi>love</hi> too, in that place of the <hi>Romans</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things worke together for the beſt to thoſe that love God:</hi> they are in a condition of happineſſe, in a way to, and in a poſſeſſion of happineſſe that love God: but now you muſt not take either of theſe in oppoſition to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or without knowledge, for without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, theſe affections cannot bee wrought, nor have any acceptance, nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: but you muſt take them in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>And ſo moſt frequently the Scripture aſcribes happineſſe unto <hi>obedience</hi> alone, as to name but one place, that in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 15. where the inquirie is made, <hi>Who ſhall come into Gods Tabernacle,</hi> who ſhall be the happie man here and hereafter? the

               <p n="2">2 But now take them <hi>conjunctly</hi>;<note place="margin">Conjunctly.</note> ſometime two of them are joyned together, and ſometime all three: I will give you an inſtance of ſome few places of either.

               <p>And as knowledge and obedience are joyned together, ſo ſometime <hi>knowledge and feare:</hi> as to inſtance in the <hi>Proverbes</hi> 9.10. <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdome</hi> (as the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had it) and he that knowes him, or the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him is underſtanding: i.e.</hi> perfecting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſound underſtanding, which will be

I tell thee what it is good for, it is better then all thoſe things you hunt after: for they will never put you in a way of happineſſe: but walking in the way of religion puts you in the way of happineſſe alone; it is onely the knowing, and fearing, and loving, and ſerving of God (which is the ſumme of the true religion) that is the plaine path-way of happineſſe: this therefore confutes all thoſe ignorant conceits
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18414:110"/>
that the blinde nature of man, the blinde under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of man is ready to fall on, and to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and drawne away by, as it were with <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> which, as ſome fable, drawes out of their way in the night.

and that in ſome degree of profunditie, ſolid, and ſubſtantiall, the meere ignorant man that knowes not theſe things, as hereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that hee is out of the way to happineſſe: and which is worſe, I am afraid, even in theſe times of knowledge, (though it bee a ſhame it ſhould bee ſo, and a griefe to thinke on it, that it is ſo) I am afraid, I ſay, that there be many men, not only of the poorer ſort of people, that by reaſon of the meanes of their condition, have no generous thoughts in themſelves, nor looke after matter of knowledge, who cannot ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the uſe of the meanes, I meane, come to Church, in that they have not time to ſpare to come, nor underſtandings to reach what they heare when they come. But beſides theſe, I am afraid even many men and woemen, in gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die coats, and gay cloaths, yea, and I am afraid too many, that are of good intellectuals, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for other things, as for the world, and their Trade, for plentie, and honour, and riches, and as we uſe to ſay of a Top, the keene point of it is towards the earth, but it is flat and dull enough towards Heaven, and heavenly things: I am afraid, I ſay, that they have not at leaſt a ſound and ſolid knowledge; but content themſelves either with none at all, or at beſt, very little; though they know other things, yet they care not for religion; or if they doe, they content themſelves with a ſuperficiall ſwiming knowledge, or ſome generall knowledge of God. But certainly beloved, know, that they

that have not knowledge, and a competent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of knowledge in ſome meaſure and degree of the maine things of Religion; theſe men muſt needs bee cleane out of the way to happineſſe, that is a cleare truth.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18414:115"/>
this in the higheſt place and higheſt rancke, the divine knowledge of God, and thoſe things that concerne our happineſſe in God. And this is the ſcope of the exhortation in regard of this, that we would be contented to take a little paines from other things to get this divine knowledge; at leaſt not to ſquander away all our precious time, and parts, buſily in the purſuit of other things that will doe us no good; but take it from them, and beſtow our ſelves, our times and our wits, for the purſuing of divine knowledge, which is the moſt precious of all.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Act.</note>2 In regard of the <hi>act:</hi> all that I will put you in mind of in regard of that is; that it is not a bare knowledge that I am now recommending unto you,<note place="margin">Apprehenſion.</note> which conſiſts in the apprehenſion of divine things: but a <hi>knowledge joyned with faith</hi>; mixed and tempered with faith: that the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may not only have ſome <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of thoſe things in the tenour of them,<note place="margin">Aſſent.</note> but in their conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion; ſo that the heart may cloſe with them in giving full <hi>aſſent</hi> to the truth of them; apprehend the realitie of them, to bee ſuch indeed as have a ground and ſubſiſtence: for it is one thing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the promiſe of eternall life, and to know what the happineſſe is to be in conjunction with God, to have a glorified bodie, and a glorified ſoule, farre beyond that excellencie that is here: but it is an other thing to apprehend that theſe things are really promiſed, ſhall be really perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by God, and ſo to ſet a mans ſoule to the truth of God by faith; that theſe are not only

meere words; but ſuch as indeed ſhall be exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to all Gods ſervants: many apprehend theſe things, and underſtand what is meant by them; but yet they have a root of atheiſme in their hearts, ſo that they thinke they are but deviſed things to keepe men in awe, and that there is no realitie in them, to have no ſubſiſtence: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>knowledge of apprehenſion joyned with a full aſſent of faith</hi> reſting on the truth of the things promiſed, but in this place I ſhall uſe the word no further.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18414:116"/>
Fox could not put in his head, but was faine to licke the outſide, &amp;c. I would not have men to content themſelves with the outſide, to have a little ſuperficiall notion, but the ſolidity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſts in this, that a man have a reall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and apprehenſion which doth enter into his minde, and penetrate it throughly, makes a deep impreſſion that it be received there, and ſuch an impreſſion as may put a tincture on the heart, and affections too; for indeed that is never a perfect dye of knowledge, doth not redound and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow to the affections, and draw them, leave a tincture on them; and therein indeed is the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> of knowledge, when it is ſaving and ſolid, namely then when it is penetrating, when it ſo farre fils the underſtanding, and enters ſo deeply into it; that there is a reſultance to overflow from it on the affections to inflame and draw them, that will give the through dye which is in graine, which will never out, but truly ſave.</p>

                  <note place="margin">How ſhall wee attaine to it.</note>2 This being premiſed, now let me add con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the other thing, <hi>viz. How ſhall we attaine to this knowledge:</hi> ſuppoſe we be willing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of it (as nothing indeed is more deſireable then knowledge, to be a knowing creature, a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creature, an underſtanding creature; it is <hi>pabulum anima,</hi> the food of the ſoule, a ſoule, that is a reaſonable ſoule, is as much nouriſhed and refreſhed with reaſonable things, with knowledge and other intellectuals, as the body, that is a body, is nouriſhed with corporeall ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) but ſuppoſe now we deſire this, how ſhall we attaine it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:18414:117"/>This is a large compaſſe to go through the full of it, I ſhall therefore point out briefly ſome few wayes.</p>
               <p>Two things in generall I ſhall onely ſpeake,<note place="margin">Preparatives.</note> which are as two <hi>preparatives</hi> for all things: and then I ſhall add two or three of the maine helps that are <hi>perfective</hi> in this kind, if we would attain to knowledge, ſound knowledge, and above all and eſpecially in divine things, that which we confine our ſpeech unto.</p>
               <p>There are two preparatives that are exceeding advantagious this way, to fit the ſoule to ſtand in a good poſture, to make it capacious of this divine knowledge.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>A humble ſpirit:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Humility.</note> humility is a very fit qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to make the ſoule of a man capable of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting knowledge: for as it was the ſaying of the Moraliſt, which is of more large extent, but yet holds a truth here; there is nothing hinders growth in knowledge more then a humour and ſwelling of pride: when a man is proud in his owne opinion, in conceit and apprehenſion of his owne wiſdome; he is uncapable of learning any thing; he lets ſlip the meanes and opportunities which otherwiſe he might have, onely upon a vaine conceit that he is wiſe enough already: And therefore as they uſe to obſerve the ground on which the Peacocke uſeth to ſit, is ordinarily no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be even by that occaſion made exceeding barren: I am ſure it is ſo here (the Peacocke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Embleme of pride) And there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon for it, why he is made uncapable of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18414:118"/>
knowledge. There is a <hi>morall reaſon</hi> of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 He doth by his priding of himſelfe, <hi>alienate God from him,</hi> nay and provoke God, ſo that God hath no delight to communicate himſelfe to him, for <hi>God deſpiſeth the proud, and giveth grace and knowledge to the humble, and the ſecrets of the Lord are with thoſe that feare him:</hi> he will communicate himſelfe to the humble ſpirit; and he will withdraw himſelfe from the proud ſpirit; <hi>he ſils</hi> the humble ſpirit with knowledge, but thoſe that are <hi>wiſe</hi> in their owne conceits, <hi>he ſends them away empty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 There is a <hi>naturall cauſe</hi> of it: it hinders a man from uſing any means, or from profiting by any meanes; it hinders a man from receiving any thing that is dropt into him: a proud man is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall barre or hinderance to his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or from receiving any knowledge: and therefore, as I have ſometime noted in another caſe, which is appliable here; you know, in a diſh, there is an inſide of it which is hollow, and an outſide which is convex; now if you would powre any thing in it, you muſt not powre it on the outſide which is convex, for that convex ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, by reaſon of its convexity, can hold nothing, but all runs over: But if you powre any thing in the inſide, it will hold juſt according to its proportion, as you can powre in; the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit is like the concave and hollow of the diſh, that is empty by reaſon of his humility, and ſo is capacious of any thing which God in the uſe of the meanes ſhall be pleaſed to powre in it,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18414:118"/>
it hath emptineſſe, and can hold it: but now the proud ſpirit is like the convex ſuperficies, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is but ſpilt that is powred on it; for there is no hollowneſſe, no concave, no capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to hold it. And as it is in the familiar ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the mountaines and the valleyes; the raine fals on the mountaines, and makes it nothing fruitfull, becauſe all the raine by reaſon of the proclivity, and the height of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſlips and ſlides down from the mountaine, and the mountaine ſhelves it off (as it were) from its ſelfe: and not onely caſts off the raine, but it ſelfe alſo (at leaſt the beſt of it ſelfe) with the raine; and ſo much more fattens the lower grounds, ſo that the valleyes have not onely the fruitfulneſſe that comes by the raine, but alſo that which comes by the ſoile which fals on them from the hils by the raine: And truly it is the valley, the lowly ſpirit that is made capable of any thing; but the lofty ſpirit drives all from it ſelfe, and ſo makes it ſelfe uncapable to receive any thing, and unfit to attaine any thing: And therefore if we would get knowledge, attaine to this firſt ſtep in the ladder that reacheth to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we muſt take heed of pride: the proud lofty ſpirit is not in the way to attaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor in any way to profit by the meanes which might be good for that purpoſe; but the humble ſpirit that findes an emptineſſe in it ſelfe, an hungering and thirſting after knowledge, ſuch a ſpirit is fitteſt to gaine by all advantages and all opportunities, and ſo conſequently to attaine to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18414:119"/>
knowledge: So that this is the firſt qualification to attaine knowledge, humility.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Ingenuity of ſpirit.</note>2 Another <hi>preparative</hi> is <hi>ingenuity of ſpirit</hi>; that is an excellent preparing qualification to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge, and profiting by the meanes of knowledge: A man that is of an ingenuous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will interpret what I meane by that; though at the firſt thoſe that are not learned underſtand it not; yet that all may, I comprehend in it theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A man muſt be free from <hi>partiality and prejudice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And a man muſt be <hi>full of an eſtimacie, and good opinion, and good affection toward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuch ingenuity of ſpirit prepares a man exceedingly for thriving by the meanes of knowledge, and ſo for attaining the thing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">Freedome from partiality and prejudice.</note>1 For the former <hi>freedome from prejudice and partiality</hi>; that is neceſſary, for if a man be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially-minded, it will hinder him in profiting by the meanes of knowledge: as for example; ſuch partiality whereby one eſteemes of men, and ſo that he diſeſteeme all others; perhaps this man may get a little by that man whom he doth eſteeme, but looſe a great deale for it by reaſon of his partiality: and why? becauſe he cannot alway heare one, he therefore never comes to heare any other: and if he doth, his partiality choakes the benefit: And ſo for <hi>prejudice,</hi> to come with a prejudicate opinion to the hearing
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18414:119"/>
of any man, or the reading of any thing, to have the mind poſſeſſed and anticipated with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, it will hinder a man from attaining to that knowledge which otherwiſe he might gaine by that man, or that thing: As if a man now have a fault in his eyes, it will hinder him from ſeeing any thing which is before his eyes; or ſuppoſe they be muffled, or hudwinked (although he hath a power of ſeeing, yet being hudwinkt) he cannot ſee: A man blindfolds himſelfe with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice from ſeeing that which he might ſee: And therefore if we would get knowledge, and thrive by thoſe meanes that tend that way; a man ſhould lay this preparation of an ingenuous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, being free from prejudice: gold is gold where ever you finde it; and truth is truth from whomſoever I take it; If a blinde man give me gold, it is gold; and where ever I finde it, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the dunghill) yet the pearle hath his price ſtill: and ſo by whatſoever meanes the thing is conveighed to me (if I be not partially minded) the thing doth not looſe the worth, or the uſe: It is daintineſſe of ſpirit, that a man will not receive knowledge except he may chuſe the party by whom, or the meanes by which he may receive it: A man muſt therefore be free from partiality in this caſe; a hungry ſtomacke will never refuſe meat becauſe it is in an earthen diſh; a cloyed ſtomacke indeed is ſquemiſh; but yet I ſay, if a man be put on it, and hungry, he will not refuſe a good meſſe, becauſe it is not in a golden diſh, or a ſilver diſh, &amp;c. That is the firſt
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18414:120"/>
thing therefore in this preparative, ingenuitie of ſpirit, by being free from partialitie, and prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Full of,</note>There is yet (as I ſaid) an other thing in this <hi>ingenuitie</hi> of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as the minde ſhould bee free from theſe things, ſo it ſhould be full of another thing,<note place="margin">Eſtimation. Affection.</note> 
                  <hi>viz. eſtemacie,</hi> and <hi>good affection of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> a man muſt come to the uſe of the meanes by which we may get knowledge with a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and eſtimation of the excellencie of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: it was the Orators expreſſion, if a man bee <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, if a man have a good opinion and eſtimation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo that his affections are ſtrongly bent towards it, it is ſtrange what a man may doe, his good affection towards it, and good eſtimation of it, will worke out thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and overcome thoſe dangers, that may hinder his attaining to it. They tell of that great Orator of <hi>Athens,</hi> the Prince of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faculties, <hi>Socrates,</hi> that hee had as many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and impediments to hinder him from attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eloquence as ever any had; hee could not ſo much as ſpeake plaine the firſt letter of his art, hee could not pronounce it, having a defect in his tongue; yet hee had ſo high an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of eloquence, that in the ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he went through all thoſe difficulties, that he became the greateſt in that facultie: And this is that which <hi>Salomon</hi> intends, in <hi>Proverbs</hi>

               <p n="2">2 Now for the perfections,<note place="margin">Perfection.</note> that will come in upon theſe, as the maine and principall things, (for thoſe be not expreſſed here, but as the firſt tincture to give the farther dye, but to prepare the thing for it, to prepare the minde for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) but the maine and principall things for the gaining of knowledge are three; which I will mention, and but mention them.</p>

Theſe are the three maine things, that may,<note place="margin">Be conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</note> and doe advance knowledge, by any, yea by all the meanes of knowledge.</p>
               <p>A man that is <hi>conſcientious,</hi> hee waits on the meanes of knowledge, that hee may come to know, not becauſe he would know for <hi>curioſitie,</hi> but that hee may know in conſcience, that hee may bee able to direct his owne wayes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his owne parts, that ſo, hee may bee a meanes to edifie others, and advance Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: he that conſcientiouſly deſires his knowledge for the true ſcope and end of knowledge; which is to doe himſelfe and others good, hee is the beſt qualified man for the attaining of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and hee may moſt confidently expect Gods bleſſing on it; for God will beſtow, and

A man therefore that would thrive and increaſe in knowledge, muſt make precious account and uſe of the meanes; hee muſt reſolve thus much at leaſt to lay up ſome thing out of every opportunitie that hee hath; to keepe a ſtocke of knowledge, and adde little to little; hee muſt labour to learne ſomething this day; and ſomething the next day, and ſo to treaſure up ſomething out of all opportunities at leaſt.</p>
               <p>And not onely this for the publike;<note place="margin">Private:</note> but a man muſt labour to doe ſomething in <hi>private</hi>; hee muſt bee content likewiſe to uſe ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in private.

or profeſſion they will: they muſt if ever they will looke to come to happineſſe, if they bee of God, and would enjoy God, and bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Chriſtians, they muſt looke after theſe things that tend and conduce this way, that is a generall thing that belongs to all. And therfore I conceive this is one of the maine impediments, why men who live under the meanes both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private, and yet alaſſe, die of poore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and leave but little that appeareth of any ſtocke, or advantage that they have made under theſe meanes of knowledge; I ſay one of the maine reaſons is, not onely becauſe they doe neglect to attend the publike, or if they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, it is for ſome other end and purpoſe, not with a minde to grow and increaſe in the knowledge and grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to increaſe and adde to their ſtocke of knowledge, but as the ſaying is, <hi>In parabola Ovis Capras quarunt: i. e.</hi> come for ſome other end: but it is not onely the neglect of the publike, I ſay, for ſuppoſe a man doe attend on it, and bend his eares to goe along diligently to heare and underſtand the thing that a man heares, and ſo to advantage himſelfe in knowledge, labouring alſo to revit and faſten in his memorie thoſe things hee heares and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, that they ſlip not out, locking up all thoſe doores that might let it out, as his eyes from gazing up and downe, and his eares from liſtning to other matters, and ſo ſtopping as it were, all the chincks, that his memorie may
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18414:123"/>
hold and keepe it faſt: yet I ſay for all this, (I would have you marke it) if men will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all in private, being gone out of the Houſe of God in publike, never <hi>meditate</hi> on that which hee hath heard; never chew the cud as it were; never rowle that ſweet bit hee had in his mouth, never chafe it by private meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as to make a full impreſſion on his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſo more ſtrongly locking it up in his memorie: if a man, I ſay, will take no paines in private, it is impoſſible that hee who comes out of buſineſſe up to the eares (as wee ſay) thicke and threefold, and as ſoone as ever hee goeth out, plungeth himſelfe up head and eares in the ſame buſineſſe againe, and will give no reſt for to ruminate on, and digeſt what he hath heard, it is I ſay, impoſſible hee ſhould adde any thing to his knowledge: a man muſt therefore bee ſo diligent for to attaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to adde ſome private meanes to the publike, and not bee like a childe alwayes, to eate no more then is put into his mouth with a ſpoone, from the mouths and hands of them whoſe lips ſhould preſerve knowledge; but himſelfe muſt feed at home, and ſpend ſome time, imploy his parts in ſome ſort, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his condition and vocation, (ſo much as hee can well beſtow) to increaſe his knowledge: for otherwiſe if men doe not adde ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diligence, it is impoſſible that a meere houre ſpent here ſhould doe him much good, (if any at all) eſpecially when hee comes full

               <p>There is another thing alſo beſides this: as they that would have knowledge, muſt have conſcience to deſire it for the true end, which is to doe themſelves good, and ſteere their owne courſe aright; as alſo to advance Gods glorie, labouring by their knowledge to doe good to others, and ſo are in a good capacitie of knowledge: And adde to this, they muſt have diligence; which is another good capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie for the attaining of knowledge, for the hand of the diligent maketh rich, and even in this kind of riches too.</p>

ſome men will goe as farre with a little, as ſome others with ten times as much; and all is by reaſon of prudent managing: a man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps beſtow more time, and uſe more diligence for getting knowledge then another, and yet never attaine as much as hee, in reſpect of his naturall parts: but ſuppoſe an equalitie, not onely in the qualification of parts, but alſo in the parts of nature (for ſome men by reaſon of their naturall abilities may attaine more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in an houre, than others in a weeke, by reaſon of their dulneſſe of minde, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of memorie) but ſet them I ſay at equall; and you ſhall ſee that a man that hath prudence, prudently to order that little time which hee ſpends to attaine to knowledge, with a wiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and good diſcretion, to make choiſe of thoſe wayes and that meanes, by which he may moſt thrive and advantage himſelfe in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, this prudent ordering of his time and paines, may bee, and is as much, and of as great importance as a great deale of buſineſſe; a man may be as buſie as others, and yet gaine nothing, by reaſon that hee wants prudence: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this therefore, if wee would attaine to knowledge, wee muſt labour for prudence, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to make choiſe of what wee heare, and what wee read, to make choiſe of thoſe that will moſt increaſe and direct our knowledge: and not to ſquander away and ſpend our time in ſearching after thoſe things, which when wee have ſound, wee ſhall make no great advantage

               <p>There bee ſo many particulars that would come in here, that I ſhall not enter into any of them.</p>
               <p>And therefore in a word, thoſe qualifications before being ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that a man bee thus prepared with humilitie and ingenuitie of ſpirit: and will put himſelfe on it, with a conſcience to aime at Gods glory and his own ſpirituall good, the true end of knowledge: and not to abuſe his knowledge, to get skill, like a mad man, to cut his owne throate, or like a curious man to hurle and tumble every thing he comes by, to quarrell and jangle in diſputes and reaſonings, maintaining contradictions; but to doe himſelfe and other good, if a man be thus conſcientious in regard of his end in ſeeking after knowledge, and to this add diligence and prudence in uſing of the means to attaine knowledge: theſe are the maine things to fit us and enable us for the having and gaining of knowledge; and that ſhall ſuffice for that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing that I now aime at in the generall.</p>

               <p n="1">1 We were borne, and live now under the <hi>times of the Goſpell,</hi> which is infinitely advanced for matter of light and knowledge beyond the times of the <hi>Law:</hi> All was in darke ſentences then, in riddles as it were, all was veiled then, <hi>Moſes</hi> was veiled then; and there was but a little to be knowne clearely then in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then was that ſaying true, <hi>&amp; latet, &amp; lucet,</hi> there was a little light, but it was hidden, and it had many coverings that kept men from the cleare ſight of the myſtery of grace: But now God hath clearely revealed his face in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and theſe are the times, theſe (I ſay) are times of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Nay more particularly, theſe are times of the <hi>Reformation,</hi>

And therefore let every man think what an account and reckoning he will have for living in thoſe times, wherein he hath ſo much meanes, and ſo many opportunities, and to be found to be ſo bad an husband, as to have laid up no ſtocke of knowledge; that comes not onely ſhort in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellencies, but in this which is an infinite ſhame, and will be an infinite bitterneſſe in the end: and which would, at leaſt ſhould make a mans heart to ake, nay bleed, to thinke that any in theſe times ſhould ſit in darkneſſe, and be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge: which notwithſtanding I feare not only many poore ſoules that are as yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, want, but even many that are full of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge otherwiſe, not giving their mindes to this kinde of knowledge, having an undervaluing eſteeme of it, and no affections to it: And I doubt that many that are otherwiſe in gay garbs, and great places, and it may be of excellent parts, and excellent indowments, yet are to ſeeke and come ſhort of this knowledge; and it is a very ſad thing to thinke of it: And therefore let us conſider what hath beene ſaid, and ſet our ſelves to advance and increaſe our knowledge, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meanes and opportunities which we have.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Becauſe they are the <hi>beſt fruit of all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:18414:136"/>2 It is the <hi>next root of all obedience:</hi> If knowledge be precious unto us, then ſhould heavenly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">Next roote of obedience.</note> for the pearle and price of our knowledge is when it elevates and workes in us holy affections: And if obedience be deſirable, if obedience bee worth the while; then holy affections which are the very next roote of our obedience, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and worth the while; for from it, it iſſues and flowes, and receives it life and ſtrength: It is juſt with the ſoule as it is with the body; the nerves and muſcles are the inſtruments of motion: that I pull in or put out my hand or foot, or open or cloſe my eyes, it is by a ſecret and inward power of the muſcles, nerves and ſinewes; by which I rule theſe, and order theſe parts as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is: and ſo it is in the ſoule, all outward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in obedience, it will bee but a meere pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-play, except it be from an inward motion, a popet is a dead thing except ſome man move it, the wind may move it, it is but meerely carried in mens hands, and not by any naturall motion or life: But then only is our obedience right and lively, when it hath an inward motion, a motion of love, or feare, when it riſeth from a root of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections: when a man loves God, and feares God, then is he fit to ſerve and obey God: <hi>timor addidit alas,</hi> and ſo <hi>amor</hi>: feare giveth wings, and love is the moſt compelling thing, for <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us</hi> to make us induſtrious to ſerve God; the act of love or feare is great: affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the beſt root, to thruſt plenty of ſappe forth, to make all our actions greene, and freſh, and flouriſhing.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:18414:136"/>3 As affections are the beſt fruit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if we value knowledge; and as they are the next root of obedience, if wee prize obedience;<note place="margin">Only grace of either, without which Knowledge is not ſaving.</note> ſo they are the <hi>onely grace of both:</hi> neither of them hath any grace on it, or any gloſſe, or beauty in it, without heavenly affections; <hi>Knowledge,</hi> (let it be never ſo great, never ſo profound, never ſo univerſall, never ſo cleare, yea in divine things, yet) it is not <hi>ſaving,</hi> till it bee mingled with holy affections, till it have begotten and brought forth them: All our knowledge without affections, is not ſaving; but a man may goe like a Bull with Coronet and garland when he goes to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a man may go to hell and periſh everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all theſe ornaments of knowledge in his head: knowledge is not ſaving, except wee have this ornament in our hearts of ſpirituall and holy affections: And therefore as the Father ſayd in a patheticall bemoaning of thoſe that were learned men; men of great parts, but cold affections: <hi>Surgunt indocti, &amp; coelum rapiunt; &amp; nos cum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinis noſtris ſine corde, ecce ubi volutamur in carne &amp; ſanguine:</hi> that is, the unlearned ariſe and ſnatch heaven, and ſhall we periſh with all our learning? they out-goe the learned in this, they that have heavenly affections.

reach himſelfe fartheſt; this man would carry it: but it was not he that could reach fartheſt, but hee that could runne faſteſt, that bare away the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And it is not thoſe that have the deep reach in religion, but thoſe that have the beſt ſpeed in religion, the ſweeteſt affection in religion: It is heavenly affection that puts the grace on our knowledge, yea and puts a life into it, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe would bee but a dead knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obedience not pleaſing.</note>And againe <hi>obedience</hi> without holy affections will not bee <hi>pleaſing</hi>: except it proceed out of a root of holy affections, and what we doe, (let us doe it never ſo buſily) if wee doe it not out of the feare of God, and conſcience to him; if we do it not out of love, and ſweet and heavenly affections towards him, it hath no acceptance with God, nor is it available: The heathens had many acts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as juſtice, and temperance, and chaſtity, and ſuch like vertues, which were but wild plants, not gardens planted, nor having their due <hi>culture</hi>; they were never cultured by God in his garden, becauſe they grew not upon the right root; they were done in ſelfe-love, for their owne glory, as the <hi>Stoikes</hi> were called, they were <hi>animalia gloriae,</hi> men that aimed at ſelfe-love and their owne vaine glory in doing of them, and therefore they had no acceptance with God. But it is theſe holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that <hi>God</hi> looks at in all our actions, and which alone puts the price upon all our obedience: He that giveth but a little in a way of charity, ſo it be out of affection, is accepted: It is not the greatnes of the guift; but the riches of the mind that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18414:137"/>
not the great guift, but the rich mind hath acceptance with God: The Widdowes mite, was beyond the rich mans magnificence, becauſe it came out of a richer mind: And ſo it is in all other actions, it is the root, from what heart they ſpring, from what affections they ſpring, that commands the actions: without which the actions looſe all their beauty.

               <p n="1">1 The firſt was; that wee muſt take heede, that our obedience <hi>ariſe from the right riſe and root</hi>;<note place="margin">Riſe.</note> that it have the right root from whence it ſprings and flowes; for that is all in all to make it proper obedience: as now when it ſprings from thoſe things that I mentioned in the other branch of the poynt; that is, from a <hi>grounded knowledge</hi> of the will of God, and <hi>faith</hi>;<note place="margin">From know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith.</note> that it is Gods will I ſhould carry my ſelfe ſo: and when it ſprings from a <hi>a holy feare and love of God,</hi>

This I ſay will be a great helpe: for the truth is, nothing in this kind commeth off hanſomly from us, if it comes not from love; it is againſt the hair, if it come not from a principle of love: whereas on the otherſide (as the ſaying was) <hi>Marti arma non ſunt onera:</hi> The <hi>commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God will not be burthenſome</hi> to us, <hi>if we love God:</hi> ſo that now the increaſing, and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every one of theſe former things, wil be a meanes to ſet us upon obedience: for every one of them ſervs proportionably, for the watering of the very root of obedience, to make it thrive and proſper: though I doe not now (for it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if I would make a young tree grow that I have planted, that I ſhould goe to the top, or boughes of the tree, and caſt water there, it is but frivolous; for it ſufficeth to caſt the water at the root; for it is the root that nouriſheth all the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and all the ſap, it is firſt at the roote, and ſo conveighed to the boughes and branches:) So it is in this caſe: I doe not ſpeake of watering the top of obedience, to make it flouriſh outwardly: but water the root, with this knowledge, and theſe affections (which are the root of all the actions of obedience) and then there will naturally iſſue

               </p>
               <p>To diſpatch that, I ſhall propound but ſome two, or three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider that <hi>obedience</hi> is the <hi>ſcope,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obedience the ſcope of both.</note> and the <hi>end,</hi> and the <hi>perfection of both the former</hi>; the very top, and crowne of knowledge and affections; the very height that they reach unto: knowledge is give that we may bee the fitter to obey: and affections are given but to ſtirre us up to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; and therefore we ſhall looſe the fruit, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18414:148"/>
ſcope, and the end of all the other preparatives, if we do not adde this: All acts of our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and affections will be imperfect, if we doe not adde obedience: for that is the ſcope and end why God gives the other: why the Spirit of God worketh the other in a mans heart; it is all but to prepare a man for this: Now if a man be furniſhed with armes to fight, he muſt fight when he is called to uſe them: And ſo in this caſe, when God giveth a man affections, and endowments, if a man uſe them not, what is hee the better?</p>
               <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Scale of truth</note> This is the very <hi>ſeale of the truth of both the former:</hi> A man can have no aſſurance that hee hath knowledge that is ſaving; or that his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſuch as are right; except both theſe ſhew themſelves by inclining us to obedience; for there is a natural l dependency betweene this and the former; betweene the actions of obedience, and the root that I ſpake of: It is impoſſible but they muſt breake forth, and ſhew themſelves in actions (at leaſt) in ſeaſonable time: It is true the tree doth not alway ſhew the life of it, by the leaves and fruit; (they are ſomething ſeparated from life) but yet that tree that doth not ſhew, (though it lye dead all the winter) that it lives in the ſpring; I ſay if it doe not ſpring up in the Sun-ſhine in ſummer; if it doe not then flouriſh, it is dead: So in this caſe, certainely though acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe not alwayes accompany us; a mans affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may bee ſtrong in him; but yet there is more required to action, then affection: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal character of grace lieth principally in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18414:148"/>
affections: and therfore when a man comes to an inward breach, that is the worſt: the externals may faile, and the Apoſtle complained of that, <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man that I am:</hi> his will was good, his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were good, but hee had not power to act; But yet when there is a ſeaſon of actions, and all things concurre; when God affords other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences in abundance to produceactions, if a man doth not bring forth action then, certainely I will conclude that knowledge is dead know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and thoſe affections are dead, that life is gone out of him, or elſe it would ſhew it ſelfe in this warme ſummer, and wee ſhould ſee both leaves and fruit: for it cannot lye hidden, (if a man have affection to God) but it will break forth upon occaſion: Obedience therefore is the ſeale of truth; &amp; we can never evidence the truth of our knowledge, and our affections, except upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wee ſhew it by the fruitfulneſſe of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

is immediately gathered as it were from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in the actions, in the utmoſt branches of the actuall obedience: Immediately wee have but little comfort from our affections, becauſe wee have bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And ſo it is in this caſe: Though our comfort doe not <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally ariſe</hi> from our obedience, yet our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence keepes our comfort warme: The more wee compaſſe our ſelves about with obedience, the more we heape up things, and doe them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of Gods word, and our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the more we abound in theſe things, the more wee keepe our comfort warme: out of what feare or love we doe them to God, there is the vitall excellency of them: but this is mightily cheriſhed by theſe breakings out in actions of obedience; it is the ſeale of our own conſolation.</p>
